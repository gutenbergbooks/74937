<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“Knowing by delightful experience the great descriptive powers
of the author of ‘Excursions,’ we may safely conclude that whoever
peruses them will do so with an additional satisfaction when he reflects
that they are described by the same pen which has drawn such
animated portraits of men and of nature before. This work is indeed
a most lively narrative of travels.”—Times.</p>

<p class="pfs80"><span class="smcap">Part First</span>, by the same author, in 2 vols. 12mo.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“The author of ‘The Spy,’ not content with the fame already acquired
in the field of literature, has here made another effort to impart some valuable
thoughts to the gratification of his friends and the public. The two
volumes before us are a compilation of letters written from France to the
author’s personal friends in America, but these letters will not be less acceptable
because written as private epistles, inasmuch as they contain
much of that peculiar character which instructs while it amuses. Mr.
Cooper’s testimony in relation to the then existing state of society in
France, may be considered as honest; whilst in relation to the more
weighty matters which fell under his observation, he appears to have acted
upon that most excellent appeal of Othello, ‘nothing extenuate, nor set
down aught in malice’”—<cite>American Citizen.</cite></p>

<p>“Whatever Mr. Cooper undertakes to describe, he does it with the hand
of a master, and a single chapter of description from his vigorous pen, conveys
more distinct ideas of the things and persons of whom he writes, than
all the volumes of First Impressions which have ever been published. His
views of society are also such as may be studied with advantage; and it is
to be hoped that the results of his experience will not be entirely lost on
his fellow citizens.”—<cite>Saturday News.</cite></p>

Stewart of Colkness, &amp;c., including upwards of one hundred and
fifty Letters, hitherto unpublished: a memoir of the Court of
George 1st, by Lady Mary Wortley Montague: a sketch of the state
of parties by Mr. Wortley, and a life of the authoress: the whole
work illustrated with anecdotes and explanatory notes. Edited by
Lord Wharncliffe, her great-grandson.</p>

<p class="fs80">In this edition the names formerly given only in initials and the
suppressed passages are restored, from the original MSS. in the
possession of Lord Wharncliffe.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“Beautiful, classical and interesting are the letters and works of Lady
Mary Wortley Montague. Long as the English language shall hold a place
amongst the nations of the earth—just so long will those eloquent letters
be considered amongst the standards of its purity and excellence. We
would ask—where, either in ancient or modern times, have a series of letters,
extending through many years, been published, that contain so elegant
a commixture of the <i lang="la">utile et dulce</i>—the instructive and the entertaining.”</p>

<p>The entire work is edited by her ladyship’s great-grandson, Lord Wharncliffe,
who has added a large quantity of additional correspondence from
the family papers, and anecdotes which his lordship obtained from the
Marquis of Bute and Lord Dudley Stuart.</p>

<p>All who desire to acquire an elegant and fluent style, with a lively and
agreeable diction, should read the writings of Lady Mary Wortley Montague.—<cite>Penn.

<p class="pfs90">TUCKER’S JEFFERSON.</p>

<p class="fs80">The Life of Thomas Jefferson, third President of the United
States, with parts of his correspondence, never before published,
and notices of his opinions on questions of Civil Government, National
Policy, and Constitutional Law, by George Tucker, Professor
of Moral Philosophy in the University <ins class="corr" id="cat-1" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'o. Virginia'">
of Virginia</ins>, with an engraved bust, in two volumes.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“The style of the work is altogether historical, and in its method and
manner is alike deserving of praise. So many points of interest, however,
arise to our mind in speaking of the work, and which it would be impossible
to discuss in a newspaper, that we must dismiss it with the general
commendation, that it is one which every political party will derive equal
interest and instruction in perusing.”</p>

<p>“The work is written throughout with candour and temperance of feeling.
In the difficult necessity of pursuing an even and continuous thread
of narrative amid the innumerable distracting influences of public and
private questions, with which his subject is necessarily connected, and usually
so fatal to the biographer of a public character—Professor Tucker has
been singularly successful, diverging just enough to exhibit the cause and
its effect in juxtaposition, and never enlarging into a needless prolixity of
detail.”—<cite>Metropolitan.</cite></p>

<p>“From an author of such capacity, possessed of so many valuable sources
of information, the public may reasonably expect a full and perfect history
of the political and private life of Thomas Jefferson—friendly to his reputation
and character of course—but as impartial as the imperfection of
human nature will permit.”—<cite>Baltimore Gazette.</cite></p>

<span class="fs70">TO RICHARD COOPER, ESQ., COOPERSTOWN, N. Y.</span></h2>


<p>The last month has been one of severe duty with
the knife and fork. Through the hospitality and
kindness of Mr. Rogers I have dined no less than
three times with him alone.</p>

<p>On the first occasion our party consisted of lords
<ins class="corr" id="tn-13" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Lansdown, Grey, and'">
Lansdowne, Grey, and</ins> Gower,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Sir Thomas Lawrence,
Mr. Luttrell, and myself. I have little to
tell you of this dinner, which was like any other.
I thought some of the company stood too much in
awe of the great man, though I did not see why, for
there is no one here with whom I feel less restraint,
myself, than with Lord Grey. Of course one
defers naturally to a man of his years and reputation,
but beyond this, I found nothing to check conversation.</p>

<p>The painter is a handsome, well-behaved man,
though he was not at his ease. In the course of the
evening he inquired if I knew Gilbert Stewart.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
He had a slight acquaintance with him, and wished
to know if “he were not a very facetious gentleman.”
I was of opinion that Stewart invented to
amuse his sitters. This, Sir Thomas then observed,
explained a report he had heard, according to
which, Mr. Stewart had claimed him as one of his
pupils; an honour I thought he rather pointedly
disavowed. Our artist does not appear to be much
known here. It is the fashion to decry Mr. West
now, quite as much as it was to overrate him while
the island, by the war, was hermetically sealed
against continental art. We constantly run into
the extreme of over-estimating the celebrity of our
own people in this part of the world. So far as
my experience goes, Washington and Franklin are
the only two Americans who enjoy thoroughly
European reputations. I mean by this, that were
their names mentioned in a drawing-room, every
one would know who they were, their peculiar
merits, and the leading points in their histories.
Jefferson would, I think, come next; after which,
the knowledge of individuals would be confined
chiefly to the respective professions. There are men
who live by writing for the periodicals, and such is
the craving for novelty, that they lay heaven and
earth under contribution for subjects. In this way,
an article occasionally appears that treats of American
things and American names, and, in the simplicity
of our hearts, we fancy the world is meditating
on our growing greatness, when in fact, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
periodicals themselves scarcely attract attention.
Indeed, one of the things that has struck me
favourably here, is the practice which people have
of doing their own thinking. Puffs and advertisements
may help a work off, but they do not, as with
us, bestow reputation. Nothing is more common
than to hear opinions of books and pictures, but I
do not remember ever to have heard a remark concerning
the notions of the reviewers. Reviews
may control the inferior classes, but they have little
or no effect on the higher. Intelligence, breeding,
tone, taste, and manners, rally in such masses in
these huge capitals, that they not only make head
against the inroads of vulgarity and ignorance, but
they even send forth a halo that sheds a little light
out of their own proper sphere; whereas, with us,
like treasures exposed to invasion, they are in constant
risk from an incursion of the barbarians, who
sometimes fairly get them in their clutches.</p>

<p>Mr. Alston is less known than I had supposed,
though where known he seems to be appreciated.
I should say Mr. Leslie is more in possession of the
public, here, than any other American artist, though
scarcely known out of England, for a painting has
not ubiquity, like a book. Mr. Newton’s reputation
is limited. We boast too much of these gentlemen;
not on account of their merits, for each
has great merits in his way; but because I think
neither is particularly anxious to meet our prurient
attachment. Mr. Leslie is a mild man, and cares<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
little, apparently, for any thing but his tastes and his
affections; the latter of which do not turn exclusively
to America. He was born in London, and has told
me that his first recollections are of England. Mr.
Newton has quite pointedly given me to understand
that he too was born a British subject, and
that he thinks himself an Englishman. If any man
is excusable for deserting his country, it is the
American artist. His studies require it, even, and
there is little to gratify his tastes at home. As
respects these two gentlemen, the accidents of
birth are in unison with the accidents of their profession,
and it really seems to me we should show
more self-respect by permitting them to choose
their own national characters.</p>

<p>At the second dinner we had ladies; the sister of
the poet presiding. We were kept waiting a good
while for two or three gentlemen who were in the
House of Lords, where it seems an interesting
debate occurred on a party question, but we sate
down without them. We had at table, Mr.
Thomas Grenville; a Lord Ashburnham, who,
when asked the question, confessed he had not been
in the House, except to take the oaths, in seventeen
years; and Lady Aberdeen, the wife of the minister.
Lady —— was also of our party. The absentees
left large gaps at the board, and our dinner was
<i lang="fr">tant soit peut</i> dull.</p>

<p>In the course of the evening, Mr. Grenville related
a very amusing anecdote of Scott. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
dined in company with the Princess of Wales,
while she was in her equivocal exile at Blackheath.
After dinner, the party was grouped around the
chair of the Princess, when the latter said abruptly,
“They tell me, Mr. Scott, you relate the prettiest
Scotch stories in the world; do have the goodness
to relate me one.” This was making a little of
a mountebank of the great bard to be sure, but his
deference for royal rank was so great that he merely
bowed, and said “yes, madam,” and began—“In
the reign of king such a one, there lived in the
highlands of Scotland, such a Laird,” going on with
his legend, as if he were reading it from a book.
The story was short, neatly told, and produced a
good effect. “Dear me! Mr. Scott, what a clever
story!” exclaimed the Princess, who, if all they
say about lineage and blood be true, must have been
a changeling, “pray, be so obliging as to tell me
another.” “Yes, madam!” said Scott, and without
a moment’s hesitation he went on with another, as a
school-boy would go through with his task!</p>

<p>Mr. Grenville asked me if John Jay was still
alive. On hearing that he was, he spoke of him in
high terms, as a man of abilities and sterling integrity.
I should say Mr. Jay has left a better name
in England, than any diplomatic man we ever had
here. In general, I think the disposition is to
“damn us with faint praise;” but the respect of Mr.
Grenville seemed sincere and cordial. Dr. Franklin
is not a favourite in London; more than one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
the prominent men among the English statesmen
speaking of him, in my presence, in any thing but
terms of admiration.</p>

<p>It is not a safe rule to take the opinion of England
concerning any American in public life, for
it is very often “<i lang="fr">tant mieux, tant pis</i>” with
them, but there is a sturdy honesty in the better
part of this nation that gives a value to their judgments
in all matters of personal integrity and fair
standing.</p>

<p>After dinner, our peers came in full of their
debate, and as merry as boys. Lord Holland was
one of them, and he was quite animated with what
had passed. It seems my bishop had made a speech,
which they pronounced rather illogical.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott soon after joined us. Although
so complaisant to a princess, he showed he had stuff
in him, to-night. There was a woman of quality
present, who is a little apt to be <i lang="fr">exigeante</i>, and
who, I dare say, on a favourable occasion, might
ask for three stories. No sooner did the great poet
appear in the door, than, although in a remote part
of the room, she addressed him in a decided voice,
asking him how he did, and expressing <em>her</em> delight
at seeing him. The old man took it all like Ben-Nevis,
walking up coolly to Miss Rogers and paying
his respects, (a tribute to good manners that
scarcely silenced the other) before he made the least
reply. This was done with the steadiness, quiet,
and tact of Lafayette, certainly one of the best bred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
men of the age. Scott seems much more at his
ease in London than he did in Paris, where the romance
and the <i lang="fr">empressement</i> of the women had the
effect to embarrass him a little.</p>

<p>The third of Mr. Rogers’s dinners was given
expressly to Sir Walter Scott, I believe. We had
at table, Sir Walter himself, Mr. Lockhart, Mrs.
Lockhart, and Miss Anne Scott; Mr. Chantrey, Lord
John Russell, and Mr. Sharp, a gentleman who is
called “Conversation Sharp,” Sir James Macintosh,
and a Mr. Jekyll, who, I was told, from his intimacy
with George the Fourth and his wit, has
obtained the name of the “king’s jester.” Mr.
Leslie came in before we left the table, and in the
drawing-room we had Mrs. Siddons and several
more ladies.</p>

<p>There is something too gladiatorial about such
dinners, to render them easy or entertaining. As
a homage to Scott it was well enough, but it wanted
the <em>abandon</em> necessary to true enjoyment. No one
talked freely, even Mr. Sharp, who has obtained so
much reputation for ability in that way, making one
or two ineffectual rallies to set us in motion. I
have met this gentleman frequently, and, though a
sensible and an amiable man, I have been a good
deal at a loss to imagine how he got his appellation.
In comparison with that of Sir James Macintosh his
conversation is gossip. I do not mean by this,
however, that Mr. Sharp indulges in trivial subjects,
but it strikes me, he has neither reach of mind,
information, originality, wit, nor command of language,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
to give him reputation in a town like London,
and yet he is every where called “Conversation
Sharp.” In short, if I had not been told that
such was his <i lang="fr">sobriquet</i>, I should have said he was
a sensible, amiable, well-read person, of social habits,
and who talked neither particularly well, nor yet so
ill as to attract attention, and just about as much as
a man of his age ought to talk. He seems rather
more disposed than usual, to break the stiff silence
that sometimes renders an English party awkward,
and may have become distinguished in that way, for
the man who will put Englishmen at ease in company,
meaning Englishmen of a certain class,
merits an illustration. Before this dinner, however,
I have never observed so much of this social
awe, in the better company, here. A caste or two
lower in the scale, it becomes characteristic of the
national manners, always excluding, of course,
those who are so low as to be natural. I think the
<em>people</em> of England are more hearty, cordial, and
free in their modes of intercourse, than the people
of America, though certainly less <em>parochial</em>; the
application of which term I shall leave you to discover
for yourself.</p>

<p>Mr. Jekyll has a reputation for chaste wit. To-day
he was not distinguished in this respect, though
I observed that the company occasionally smiled at
his remarks, as if they associated cleverness with
his conversation. In this particular, I question if
there is a man in London, above the level of story-tellers
and jokers, who is the equal of Mr. W——.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>It strikes me the English are drilled into a
formality that throws a cloud over their social intercourse.
As a people they are not fluent, and the
itching desire to catch the tone of the highest
class has probably a bad effect; for a man may be a
peer, or a great commoner, without being much
gifted with intellect. It is true, that Englishmen
of this class are generally respectable, but mere
respectability of mind will not suffice for great
models, and when a body of merely respectable
men impart a tone to others, which originates in
their own incapacity, it has the effect to restrain
talents. Individuals like Sir James Macintosh
and Mr. Coleridge overcome this by the force of
their impulses, and the consciousness of power, but
thousands of men, highly, though less gifted than
they, are curbed by the established forms. This is
but speculation, after all, and quite likely it is valueless.</p>

<p>I have told you Mrs. Siddons and several other
ladies joined us in the evening. Mr. Rogers presented
me to the former, but her reception was cold
and distant. Drawn out, as I had been, especially
for this introduction, I could not withdraw abruptly
without saying something, and I remarked that our
papers, perhaps idly, had been flattering the Americans
that she was about to visit the country. She
answered that if she were twenty years younger,
she might be glad to do so, but her age now put
such a thing quite out of the question. Her air
was too much on stilts, I thought, and, though I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
dare say, it is her natural manner, it reminded me
unpleasantly of the heroine. Her voice seemed
pitched to the stately keys of a tragic queen, and her
enunciation was slightly pedantic. I should say for
the drawing-room, her tone, as relates to these peculiarities,
was decidedly professional and bad. I may
tell you many things of this nature that will be opposed
to your previous impressions, but the sources
of information, whence the portraits of the periodical
literature of the day are drawn, are to be distrusted.
There is one distinguished English writer
in particular, of whom it is the fashion to celebrate,
in constant eulogies, the grace and deportment,
who, I shall say, is one of the very worst-mannered
persons I have ever met in cultivated society.
Flattery and malice, sustained, as both are, by the
credulity and compliance of mankind, make sad
work with the truth.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Lockhart did me the favour to present me
to his wife, who is a daughter of Sir Walter Scott.
She is eminently what the French call <i lang="fr">gracieuse</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
and just the woman to have success at Paris, by
her sweet simple manners, sustained by the great
name of her father. I thought her quick of intellect
and reflective of humour. Scott himself was
silent and quiet the whole day, though he had
a good stately chat with Mrs. Siddons, who <em>dialogued</em>
with him, in a very Shaksperian manner.</p>

<p>The next day, in the morning, I had a visit
from Sir Walter, to apologise for not keeping an
engagement he had made to go with Mr. Rogers
and myself to Hampton Court, where his son
Major Scott is just now quartered. In the conversation
in which this engagement was made, I happened
to mention something connected with my
consulate, when Sir Walter inquired, with a little
interest if I were the consul of America at Lyons.
I told him I was so in commission and name,
though I had never been in the place. “Ah!”
observed Mr. Rogers, with a pithy manner he
knows how to assume—“it is a <em>job</em>.” To this I
answered, it was a bad job, then, as it returned
neither honour nor profit. Sir Walter had listened
attentively to this trifling, and he now came to
speak further on the subject, as well as to make his
apologies.</p>

<p>The late Lady Scott was the daughter of a native
of Lyons it seems, her maiden name having been
Charpentier, or <i lang="fr">Anglice</i>, Carpenter. Some person
of the family, as I understood Sir Walter, had gone
to the East Indies, where he had accumulated a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
considerable fortune, and it now became important
to his children to establish the affinity, in order to
do which, the first step was to get extracts from the
local registers, of the birth of M. Charpentier. He
brought with him a note of what he required, and I
promised to send it to the consular agent, immediately,
for investigation. In this note he described
M. Charpentier as a <i lang="fr">maître d’armes</i>, or fencing
master, a sort of occupation that would just suit his
own notions of chivalry.</p>

<p>The excuse for postponing the party to Hampton
Court, was a summons from the king to dine at
Windsor, a command of this sort superseding all
other engagements. He kindly begged me to name
another day for the excursion, but, between bad
health and business, it was not in my power to do
so. Your aunt, too, who was completely excluded
from society by her mourning, and who was now
in London for the first time, had too just a claim on
my time, to be set aside for other persons. She
wished to go to Windsor and Richmond, and into
Hertfordshire, and these considerations compelled
me to forego the rare pleasure of making a third in
a party composed of Walter Scott and Samuel
Rogers.</p>

<p>I have just missed seeing Mr. Wadsworth too, in
consequence of ill health. He dined with Mr.
Rogers, and I was asked to meet him, but my old
enemy the headache and a severe nervous attack,
obliged me to send excuses, though I put them off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
as long as I could, and drank hot tea all the morning
to get myself in trim. Mr. Rogers sent to
press me to join them in the evening, but I was
then in bed. As country air will now be useful, we
have determined to go to Windsor at once.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="LETTER_XVI">LETTER XVI.<br>
<span class="fs70">TO RICHARD COOPER, ESQ., COOPERSTOWN, N. Y.</span></h2>


<p>Whatever may be said of the beauty of the
country in England, in particular parts, it scarcely
merits its reputation as a whole. I have seen no
portion of it that is positively ugly, a heath or two
excepted, and yet I have seen more that is below
mediocrity, than above it. I am told, however, I have
not seen its finest portions. There is certainly little
to admire, in the way of landscape, immediately in
the vicinity of London, so far as I have become
acquainted with its environs, and we have now
entered and left the town in nearly every direction.</p>

<p>Taking our own village as a centre, and describing
a circle, with a radius of fifty miles, I greatly
question if all England could supply the same field
of natural beauty. Our landscapes have much the
effect of English park scenery, too, aided by the isolated
and graceful woods that belong to every farm,
and the negligent accidents of clearing, of which the
celebrated art of landscape gardening is merely an
imitation. But this country has a great advantage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
both in its higher finish and in its numerous and interesting
artificial accessories. It is only when
viewed at the distance of a mile or two, that the
scenery of our country, for instance, has the park-like
character at all; the foreground of the picture
commonly wanting the necessary polish. Still I
can recall a portion of the road between Cooperstown
and Utica, that comes almost up to the level
of what would be thought fine rural scenery even
in England, surpassing it in outline and foliage, and
perhaps falling as much short of it, by the want of
country houses and picturesque dwellings, bridges,
churches, and other similar objects. I mention
these places, because they are familiar to you, and
not because the country has no more; for I think it
may be taken as a rule, that the frequency and
negligent appearance of our woods, bring the American
landscapes, seen in the distance, much nearer
to the level of the English, than is commonly
believed.</p>

<p>There is a limit, which associates with the ordinary
English rural scene, the idea of comfort and snugness,
that is in marked contrast to the naked, comfortless
aspect of the broad, unrelieved fields of
France. This feature makes the great distinction
between the landscapes of the two countries. The
nature of the continent appears to have been cast in
a larger mould than that of this island, and when,
to this circumstance, you add the fact of the enclosures
by means of hedges, on the one side, and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
total absence on the other, you may form a tolerable
idea of the different characters of the scenery of
the two countries.</p>

<p>I am led out of London, and tempted to these
remarks, in consequence of our having profited by
the fine weather, to make several excursions into
the country, after all of which I am half inclined to
say that the town itself, possesses in its very bosom,
finer rural beauties than are to be met any where in
its neighbourhood. I have great pleasure, as the season
advances, in studying the varying aspects of the
parks, which, at moments, present singularly beautiful
glimpses. The <i lang="it">chiaroscuro</i> of these pictures
is not remarkable, it is true; the darks predominating
rather too much. This is a bold criticism,
considering that nature is the artist; but what I
mean is, that the play of light and shade is not as
sweet or as soft, as in milder climates. Still it is
more poetical than that of a fierce sun, unrelieved
by vapour.</p>

<p>The groupings in the parks contribute largely to
their beauty. The mixture of cows and of deer
grazing, with children at their sports, horsemen
dashing across the view, and stately coaches rolling
along the even and winding roads, add the charm
of a moving panorama, to the beauties of verdure,
trees, flowers, paths, and water. I do not, now,
allude to the Sunday exhibitions; for they are cockney,
and rather mar the scene; but to the more regular
life of the week. You can hardly imagine the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
beauty of two or three scarlet coats, passing athwart
the broad beds of verdure. I have seen battalions
parading, but the formalities of lines rather injure
than help the effect, though half a dozen soldiers,
scattered about the grass, are like so many fine
touches of light in a good picture.</p>

<p>One of our first excursions was to Richmond
Hill. We were disappointed in the view, which
owes its reputation more to the vicinity of a great
town, I suspect, than to its intrinsic merits. The
best of a capital, is pretty certain to get a name by
the mere force of tongues, and the English have
a failing in common with ourselves, which may be
attributed to the same cause—an insulated position.
This precious circumstance is quite certain to breed
cockneys. The failing is that of thinking their own
best, better than every one else’s best. Travelling,
however, is making great innovations on this
patriotic vice, and Richmond, I think, is losing its
parish fame.</p>

<p>The terrace of Richmond overlooks an exquisite
bit of foreground, however, in which the Thames
makes an admirable sweep, but the nearly boundless
back-ground is crowded, confused, and totally
without relief. When Mr. Mathews, the comedian,
was in America, I took him to the belfry of the
capitol at Albany, that he might get an accurate
notion of the localities. He stood gazing at the
view a minute, and then exclaimed: “I don’t know
why they make so much fuss about Richmond;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
now, to my notion, this is far better than Richmond
Hill.” Mr. Mathews did not recollect that they
who <em>do</em> make the fuss, scarcely ever saw any
other hill.</p>

<p>We were told the view was better from an
upper window in the inn, than from the terrace;
but I cannot think fifteen or twenty feet in elevation,
can make any decided difference in this
respect. We went into the park, but were not particularly
struck by it. There was a large herd of
deer, or I ought to say a drove, for they had a
calm and <em>sheepish</em> appearance. It is an animal that
loses its characteristic charm, in losing its sensitive,
listening, bounding wildness, and its elasticity.</p>

<p>We passed Kew and Twickenham, varying the
road a little in order to do both. The palace at the
former place is to come down, being an old German-looking
house that, as a palace, is unworthy of the
kingdom, and which has not sufficient historical
interest to preserve it. The gardens are valuable
for their botanical treasures.</p>

<p>Twickenham is an irregular old village, along
the banks of the Thames, whose beauties form its
charms. We saw the exterior of the house of Pope,
which is very much such a dwelling as would
belong to a man of moderate means and habits, in
America. Strawberry Hill was our object, here,
however, but we were denied admission. The road,
which is narrow and winding, like a lane, a beauty
in itself, runs close to the building, but a high wall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
protects the grounds. In arrangements of this sort,
the English, or rather the Europeans, much excel
us. To the great houses there is space, but they
understand the means of obtaining privacy and
rural quiet, in situations that we should abandon in
despair, on account of their publicity. Indeed few
men with us would consent to “hide their light under
a bushel,” by building a plain rear on the road,
shutting in their grounds by walls, and reserving their
elegance for themselves and their friends. I am not
quite sure the public would not treat a man’s turning
his back on it, in this manner, as an affront, and
take its revenge in biting <em>his</em> back, in return. Such,
notwithstanding, is the situation of Strawberry Hill,
little being visible from the road it touches, but a
rear that has no particular merit.</p>

<p>We were much disappointed with the house, seen
as we saw it, for it appeared to me to be composed
of <ins class="corr" id="tn-31" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'lath and stuccoe'">
lath and stucco</ins>; in part at least. It is a tiny
castle, and altogether it struck me as a sort of architectural
toy. And yet the English, who understand
these matters well, speak of it with respect,
though there is no people with whom “a saint in
crape, is twice a saint in lawn,” more than with these
grave islanders, and it may be possible they see the
wit of Horace Walpole, where I saw nothing but his
folly. Lady ——, who has so good a house of her
own, assures me the interior is quite a jewel, and
the grounds, to use an Anglicism, delicious; and
that she is in the habit of making a pilgrimage to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
the place twice a year. I’ll engage she don’t walk
on peas to do it.</p>

<p>We took another day to go to Windsor, which is
twenty miles from town. Here the Thames is
scarcely larger than the Susquehannah at Cooperstown,
flowing quite near the castle. The town is
neat but irregular, and as unlike Versailles as England
is unlike France. This is a snug, compact,
beef-and-beer sort of a place, in which one might
enjoy a sea-coal fire and a warm dinner, while waiting
for a stage coach; the other awakens the recollections
of Burgundy and made dishes, and of polite
life. One may expect a royal <i lang="fr">cortège</i> to come
sweeping down the stately avenues of Versailles at
any moment, whereas the appearance of style in
the streets of Windsor excites a sense of unfitness.
One leaves an impression of a monarch who deems
a kingdom erected for his use, who forces nature and
triumphs over difficulties to attain the magnificent;
the other, of the head of a state, profiting by accident
to obtain an abode, in which his comforts are
blended with a long chain of historical images.</p>

<p>The English say that Windsor is the only real
palace in the country, and yet it struck me as
scarcely being a palace at all. We were disappointed
with its appearance at a distance, and almost
as much with its appearance within. Like most old
castles, it is an irregular collection of buildings
erected on the edge of a declivity, so as to enclose
different wards, or courts. I believe, including its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
terraces, it embraces twelve acres. The Tuileries
and Louvre, together, must embrace forty. I should
think the buildings of Versailles, without reference
to the courts, cover more ground than are included
within the walls of Windsor, and with reference to
the courts, twice or thrice as much. A comparison
between Vincennes and Windsor would be more
true, than one between the latter and Versailles,
after allowing for the fact that Windsor is still a
royal residence. The round tower of Windsor, or
its ancient keep, will not sustain a comparison with
the <i lang="fr">donjon</i> of Vincennes, while the chapel and
royal apartments of the latter, will not compare
with those of the former.</p>

<p>Windsor is a picturesque and quaint, rather than
a magnificent place. It has a character of progressive
power and civilization, which leads the mind
to the associations of history, and which imparts to
it an interest greater than that of mere grandeur,
perhaps, but it has little pretension to be considered,
on the score of taste and splendour, the principal
residence of one of the greatest monarchs of the age;
great, in connexion with the power of the nation,
if not in connexion with his own. It would be an
admirable accessory to the state of a king; venerable
by time, and eloquent by association; but it is
defective as a principal. While it has great discrepancies
as a structure, there was a poetical imagery
about it, that insensibly led me to see a
resemblance between it and the history and institutions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
of the country; for, like them, it was the pretension
of a palace reared on a foundation of feudal
usages, aristocratical rather than royal in details,
and among which the church has managed to thrust
itself with great advantage, for the chapel, in magnificence
and extent, is, out of all proportion, the
finest and most important part of the edifices.</p>

<p>I have given you this comparative summary,
because minute accounts of this venerable castle
abound, and because these accounts do not leave
accurate notions of the respective merits of things,
without details that are fatiguing, and which are
understood only by the initiated. Still Windsor
has parts that merit particular mention, and which
are peculiar to itself as a royal residence. The first
of these is its situation, which may be classed among
the most beautiful known. The view struck me,
as far finer than that from Richmond Hill, though
not as extensive. It is not the site that would be
apt to be selected for a palace; but, as you can
easily understand, when you remember that the
Conqueror first established a hold at the place, it
has rather the features of boldness and abruptness
that belong to a fortress. These have been softened
by modern improvements, and a good terrace now
lines the brow of the hill on three of its faces.</p>

<p>The entrance is on the side of the town, and
Windsor, <ins class="corr" id="tn-34" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'like Stawberry Hill'">
like Strawberry Hill</ins>, turns its worst side
to the public. The approach is abrupt and somewhat
rude, but not without gothic grandeur. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
within the gate, one is in an irregular court, of no
great beauty, though large, but which contains the
chapel, the pride of Windsor. The courts are not
on the same level, the natural formation of the hill
still existing, one lying a little above another.</p>

<p>We were shown through the state apartments,
which greatly disappointed us, being altogether
inferior to those of almost every French palace I
have entered. There were a few rooms of a good
size, but they all had a cold German air; and their
ornaments, in general, were clumsy and in bad
taste. In nothing is the superiority of the French
taste more apparent than in their upholstery, and in
their manner of fitting up apartments, and nowhere
is this superiority more obvious than in comparing
St. Cloud with Windsor. At the latter we had
some ponderous magnificence, it is true, which
exhibited itself in such vulgarisms as silver andirons
and other puerilities; but of graceful and classic
taste, there was surprisingly little. Even the
hues of things were generally cold and chilling.</p>

<p>The castle is now undergoing very costly and
extensive repairs, however, and as George the
Fourth is allowed to have taste, if he has nothing
else, and he is openly accused of having sent to
Paris for furniture, it is probable that this description
of Windsor will soon become untrue. We saw
a few of the improvements which promise well,
and, one room in particular, a hall in which the
Knights of the Garter hold their banquets, bids fair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
to be one of the finest things in its way, in Christendom.
It is to be fitted up in a gothic taste, to
correspond with the old style of the architecture,
and, seemingly in unison with the original design.
In its present condition, I could not tell how far it
had been changed.</p>

<p>The general impression of the state apartments,
as I have just mentioned, was not favourable. They
had a stiffness and a poverty of grace, if one can use
such a term, that was obvious from the first. There
were some fine pictures, and many that were indifferent.
Sir Peter Lely flourishes here, and the state
bedchamber of the Queen, for a lady as exemplary
as Charlotte of Mecklenburgh, contains a droll collection
of female worthies, by that Corydon of
artists. Among them were Mrs. Middleton, Lady
Denham, and the Duchess of Cleveland! The
misers of Quintin Matsys are here. But you can get
better descriptions of paintings from the regular
books, than my limits, or my knowledge can help
you to.</p>

<p>The chapel is a noble structure. It is as old as
the reign of Edward the Fourth and it has a nave
worthy of a cathedral, with a superb window. The
roof is of stone, supported by ribs and groins of
beautiful proportions. This chapel is called St.
George’s, and it is appropriated to the religious
ceremonies of the Garter. The knights are installed
in the choir, which contains the banners,
stalls, and arms of the present members of the order,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
as Henry the Seventh’s chapel in Westminster, contains
those of the members of the order of the Bath.</p>

<p>The emblems of the Garter, like those of the
Golden Fleece, carry the mind back to the days of
chivalry, and to scenes of historical interest; but
they awakened in me no feelings of respect, like
those of the Bath. Personal rank is almost an
indispensable requisite to belong to the order, and
this, with personal or ministerial interest, generally
suffices. The names of the sovereigns of Austria,
Spain, Denmark, France, Prussia, and the Netherlands,
were over as many stalls. There were also
those of the Dukes of Dorset, Newcastle, Montrose,
Beaufort, Rutland, Northumberland, and Wellington.
With the exception of the last, did you ever
hear of these knights?</p>

<p>There are many monuments in this chapel, one
of which, to the Princess Charlotte, is remarkable
by the design, and I think imposing, though it is
not a favourite. West appears here, also, in a new
character, having sketched the designs for some of
the windows.</p>

<p>Eton College stands under the hill, beneath the
castle, and on the margin of the river. It is a venerable
and quaint pile, and I confess it interested me
quite as much as its more celebrated neighbour. It
was not a bad thought in Henry, to establish a seminary
like this, for the early education of the youth
of his kingdom, as it were within the shadow of his
throne. At Windsor the king is every thing, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
boys that imbibe their earliest impressions in such
an atmosphere, will be apt to feel a lasting reverence
for monarchy. But none of the English schools, I
believe, can be reproached with disloyalty, for the
English cultivate a reverence for the throne that
would seem to be pretty accurately proportioned to
their systematic intention to allow no one fairly to
fill it. They honour the king, and feed him, very
much as the Egyptians treated their Apis. After
all, <ins class="corr" id="tn-38" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'is their no analogy'">
is there no analogy</ins> between the various mystifications
of different and remote nations?</p>

<p>There are said to be near five hundred oppidans,
or boys who pay for their instruction, in the school,
and near a hundred on the foundation.</p>

<p>We strolled in the Long Walk, which is an avenue
lined by trees a league in length. This is royal
in extent, but it is scarcely in keeping with the rest
of the establishment. The park, I believe, is very
extensive, and I presume beautiful, but we had not
time to enter it. After taking a light repast, we
returned to London, by a road different from that
by which we had come.</p>

<p>We left Windsor much disappointed in many
respects, and highly gratified in others. I had
figured to myself a castle that should possess the
usual finish which belongs to the English structures
of this nature, while it was as much larger and
nobler as a king is thought to be greater than a peer,
and which was seated in the midst of such gardens
and parks as I have been accustomed to see appropriated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
to royalty elsewhere. Instead of this, the
edifices occupied by the family were scarcely better
than a first-rate Paris hotel, if indeed any better. In
the place of grandeur and state, however, we found
quaintness and historical interest, and some of the
most lovely rural scenery imaginable brought close
to the walls, to supply the places of a broad park
and formal alleys. Windsor Great Park is detached
from the castle, and, as a part of the scene, it belongs
as much to any one else as to the king.</p>

<p>In short, Windsor struck me as being a noble
feudal residence; in this sense, relatively royal; but
scarcely as magnificent and regal, as a palace.</p>

<p>We passed some very pretty houses on our way
back to London. They were not generally larger
than our own better sort of country residences, but
had fewer incongruities, a better disposition of the
grounds, and every thing was much better kept.
One in particular attracted our attention, by its
shrubbery and wood. A small lawn resembled
velvet, and a stream from the setting sun bathed
half of it in light, leaving the rest in shadow, producing
an effect like the glow of a well-toned painting.
It was the noblest colouring I had seen in
England.</p>

LETTER XVII.</ins><br>
<span class="fs70">TO MRS. COMSTOCK, COMSTOCK, MICHIGAN.</span></h2>


<p>Although Paris has so much the most reputation
for skill in the art, the English certainly do
know how to dance, whatever rumour on your
side of the Atlantic may say to the contrary. I remember
the sensation made in New York, by the
circumstance of the wife of an officer of some rank
in the British service, not knowing how to join in
the quadrilles, or cotillions rather, as far back as
the year 1815. This lady, who, by the way, was
a distant relative of your own, had been cooped up
in the island of Great Britain for twenty years, by
the war, and, either through sheer patriotism, or
because London and Paris then lay so far asunder,
her knowledge in the mysteries of Terpsichore did
not extend beyond the minuet and the country
dance, although, unlike most of those who then
came among us from Europe, she was of gentle
blood, herself, and her husband was the son of a
lord. When this lady made her first appearance at
a New York ball, to adopt a form of expression a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
good deal in vogue here, and which it is quite fair
to use in the way of retaliation, she had been just
<em>caught</em>, so far at least as dancing was concerned.</p>

<p>Times are altered, and although I will not even
now take it upon me to affirm that the English
women are as graceful, or as sylph-like, in a ballroom,
as our own, they contrive, however, by the
aid of their sweet faces, to render their quadrilles
very attractive. Since the <i lang="fr">pêle mêle</i> of society
has put an end to the public entertainments of our
own large towns, we labour under the disadvantage of
being obliged to use rooms so small that there is
little space for graceful motion; an evil that is fast
undermining our renown, in this particular, by
introducing a slovenly and careless movement.
You must look to it, or the English will come to be
your equals in this accomplishment.</p>

<p>I have been led into these profound reflections, in
consequence of having made my own appearance
at some eight or ten of the balls of London, not,
however, as an actor, but in the more sober character
of an observer. It is my intention to endeavour
to enliven your solitude near the setting sun, by
rendering some account of what I have seen. My
first appearance, at a premeditated evening party,
did not happen to be at a ball, but at one of the
receptions of a bachelor, who, in virtue of his great
wealth, high rank, spacious house, and, for any
thing I can say to the contrary, personal qualities,
is, I believe, quite generally admitted to collect the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
very social <i lang="fr">élite</i> of London. As there have been
some very silly tales told, among our friends, in
reference to my introduction to this gentleman, or
rather to his house, for to <em>him</em> I never spoke, you
will pardon a few personal details, if I tell you the
truth, by way of preface.</p>

<p>You are to know, that, under the English system
of exclusion, and owing to the silliness of man, to
say nothing of the certain quality in the ladies,
heaven and earth are sometimes moved, in order to
obtain access to particular houses. As it may be well
to understand each other on the subject of terms, let
me explain what is meant here by exclusion. English
exclusion is a wheel within a wheel; it is a
capricious and <ins class="corr" id="tn-42" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'arbritrary selection'">
arbitrary selection</ins> independently
often of rank, fortune, birth, accomplishments,
learning, or any thing else beyond mere fashion.
It probably can no more be accounted for, than the
dog, who did not eat hay himself, nor could give
a substantial reason why he refused to let the ox
have it. It is a sheer and natural consequence of
the wantonness that is engendered by extreme
luxury and a highly factitious state of things. We
make a great mistake in America, in this matter, by
blending the selection of society that are connected
with education, similarity of habits and modes of
living, unison of opinions, tastes, and breeding, with
the arbitrary exclusion that is founded on nothing
better than the whim I have just mentioned. One
is natural, the other forced; one is necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
the well ordering of society, and to the preservation
of manners and tastes, the other is an effort to
supplant the useful by the capricious; one is indispensable
to all that is respectable in the sense connected
with station, and is the only means by which
grace can be cultivated, or refinement produced,
while the other is inherently and irretrievably
vulgar. Wherever civilization exists, society will
be separated by castes, for it is not desirable to
reduce all to the same level of deportment, tastes, and
intelligence, nor possible without making a sacrifice
of that which is most estimable. All that liberty
assures us, is an entire equality of rights, and there
would be little of this in a community, in which the
cultivated and elegant were compelled to sacrifice
their feelings by an unlimited association with the
ignorant and coarse. The common sense of mankind,
every where, silently admits this, and they
who cry out loudest against it, are men who usually
are unyielding to those beneath them, and declaimers
for social equality only as respects their betters.
They do not understand the reasons of their own
exclusion, for they cannot comprehend points of
breeding they have never been taught, tastes they
have never cultivated, language they have never
heard, and sentiments they have never felt. Happily
these social divisions are inevitable, but the extreme
exclusion of the English, is a diseased excrescence;
a sort of proud flesh, that has shot up in a
moral atmosphere, in which these natural causes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
have been stimulated into unnatural action, by the
uncalled for aid of artificial stimulants and calculated
adjuncts.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you <em>why</em> the house of the Duke of
—— is considered the very centre of exclusion,
in the sense last named, at London; but I believe
such to be the fact. After a few general admissions
in favour of colour, texture, and workmanship, one
would be puzzled to say why your sex decided on
the fashion of the hat at the last exhibition of <i lang="fr">Longs
Champs</i>. The Duke of —— is neither the
oldest, the richest, the handsomest, the youngest,
nor yet the most illustrious man in London, by a
great many, and still, in a sense connected with
extreme <i lang="fr">haut ton</i>, he is, perhaps, the one most in
request. He is the most <em>fashionable</em>, and that,
until the <em>mode</em> shall be changed, is all that it is necessary
to establish, to make out my case. Mr. ——
mentioned, in conversation, that the master of this
enviable establishment, had expressed a desire that
he would invite me to be among the guests on his
next evening. “He would have sent his card, but I
told him you would not stand on the ceremony,”
added my friend. It is always so much better that
one should conform to the usages that custom and
delicacy prescribe, and this the more especially
when circumstances may render others doubtful of
their reception, that I thought he had much better
not have told him any such thing. A card would
have removed every obstacle, and, as I was on easy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
terms with the negotiator, I believe I laughingly intimated
as much. All that was said on the occasion,
was said in three minutes, and amounted to a delivery
of the request, the explanation I have mentioned,
and my laughing comment. The next day
I dined with two Americans, both of whom have
long been resident here, and the conversation
happening to turn on visits, I inquired whether
there was any exemption in the case of a peer, about
making the first visit in England, or, in short,
whether our own usage, or that of the continent prevailed.
I then mentioned the equivocal sort of
invitation I had to —— house. They both assured
me, I had not received the proper attention,
and that I was not bound to notice it, any further
than had been done, by a simple acknowledgment
of the civility of the messenger. One might go, or
not, on such an invitation. In Paris it would have
been my duty to leave a card, in such a case, and
on its being returned, I might have gone with propriety.
Under the circumstances, I determined to
let things take their course; or if Mr. —— said
any thing more about it, to go on his account; if
not, to stay away on my own. When the evening
arrived, however, Sir James Macintosh very kindly
sent a note, to say <em>he</em> would be my companion, and I
I had nothing to do but to express my acknowledgments
and readiness to accompany him; for while I
cared very little about —— house, and exclusion, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
did care a good deal about receiving such an attention
from Sir James Macintosh.</p>

<p>I have said more concerning this silly affair than
it deserves, but, having related the simple facts, it
may be well not to throw away the moral. So
much deference is paid here to rank, the cravings of
the untitled to be noticed by the titled are so strong,
and America is deemed so little worthy of taking
place with any thing, that I am not surprised
<ins class="corr" id="tn-46" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'the the truth even, in'">
that the truth, even in</ins> this case, should excite comment
among the English. But what are we to say and
think of our own manly, and “much beloved country,”
which, instead of supporting one of its citizens
in maintaining what was due not only to
himself, but to his nation, helps to confirm its present
unseemly position, by decrying what would
have been no more than an act of gentlemanly propriety
and dignity, had it occurred, and which
never having occurred at all, lends itself to the
circulation of the falsehoods, that the malignant
feelings of a set, in which even the name of America
is hated, have seen proper to set in motion!</p>

<p>The American who comes to this country, and,
forgetful of self-respect, of national pride, of the
usages of society even, becomes the toad-eater of
the great, is represented as a gentleman, as a man of
sentiment, and of delicate feelings! The crumbs of
flattery that are thrown out to him, to lead him on,
and render him ridiculous, that the people to whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
he belongs may be held up to ridicule through him,
are reported at home, with high sounding exaggerations
in his favour, while he who would simply
maintain that an American gentleman is entitled to
be treated like any other gentleman, is rendered
liable to exaggerations just the other way. After
all, unhappily, there is no more in this, than
has marked our career from the commencement.
The American who gets the good word of England
is sure of having that of his own country, and he
who is abused by England will be certain of being
abused at home. I doubt if the history of the
United States shows an instance to the contrary,
except in cases connected with the party politics of
the day, and much of the time, not even in them.
It is not possible for one living at home, fully to
comprehend the extent of the malignancy, or the nature
of the falsehoods that are industriously circulated
here, at the expense of the country and its citizens,
and so far from leaning to credulity, when any thing
of this nature reaches his own side of the Atlantic,
not only does his character for sagacity require him
to receive it with caution, but even his <em>safety</em>. If the
craven and dependent feeling which exists so
strongly in what are called the better classes of
America, on the subject of Great Britain, existed
in the body of the nation, our political union, or
political independence, in my opinion, would not
be worth ten years’ purchase.</p>

<p>I went to the lodgings of Sir James Macintosh, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Clarges Street, where we boldly entered a <em>hackney
coach</em>, together, and drove triumphantly up to the
very door of —— house. I was quite passive in this
daring act, however, and I throw the whole responsibility
on the shoulders of my learned companion.
We found the entrance thronged with footmen, and
carriages were constantly arriving.</p>

<p>—— house has one of those ill-contrived entrances,
by a flight of exterior steps, which can
never be used in bad weather, and which ought
never to be used by your sex, at all. To obviate
this difficulty, there is a more private entrance,
through the basement, by which we were admitted.
Here we found, in a sort of semi-subterraneous ante-chamber,
ladies uncloaking, amid some fifty lackies.
The room was in truth, above ground, but it
strongly reminded me of the apartment beneath the
rotunda of the capitol; that which is called the
<em>caucus</em>. A footman took our names, and we were
announced by a line of servants spread through the
passages and on the stairs. I believe there were
four repetitions, all in good audible voices.</p>

<p>As the groom of the chambers, who stands at the
door of the first reception-room, does not announce
until you arrive, this mode at least <ins class="corr" id="tn-48" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'hast the merit'">
has the merit</ins> of letting you know what is about to be said of you,
and it affords an opportunity of correcting mistakes.
On reaching this personage, he preceded us through
one room to the door of a second, where he announced
us, in the usual manner. There may be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
little more style in this method of sending up names,
but it is not easy to see its use, (unless you admit
the one already named) especially if there be a
convenient ante-chamber to uncloak in. Both the
ante-chamber, and the stairs of —— house, used
to-night, were unworthy of the rest of the exhibition.
The latter, in particular, were almost as narrow
and mean as a New York flight.</p>

<p>Lord N——, one of the men of fashion and taste
here, told me, in speaking of your sex in England,
that he fancied he could see a difference between
the women one meets with in and about Grosvenor
Square, and the women who frequent ——
house. He gave a decided preference to the latter.
When you remember that Grosvenor Square is
inhabited by some of the highest nobles of England,
and that it is one of the distinguished quarters of
the town, you will at once perceive how subtle are
the lines drawn by a fastidious taste, or, at least, by
a fancy, that is overshadowed by fashion.</p>

<p>We found some two or three hundred of the <i lang="fr">élite</i>
of the town, collected on this occasion. The master
of the house was not present, and we were
received by a sister Lady, who excused his absence
by telling us he was indisposed. After this
ceremony, we were permitted to stroll through
the rooms and to look about us. I was introduced to
a dozen people, among whom were M. Palmella,
the Portuguese ambassador, and Sir James Scarlett.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
The former was a short, compactly-built, man, like
most of his countrymen, while the latter, whom I
had figured to myself, on account of the odious
wigs of Westminster Hall, as a staid old gentleman,
with a greasy face and a red nose, was a handsome,
genteel, well-formed, and well-dressed man of
fashion. When I mentioned my surprise to ——,
he humourously remarked: “Yes, yes; he is
good-looking, and all that, but he is an impudent
dog in the house; most of the lawyers are impudent
dogs in the house.” It is impudence, you will
understand, for a new man to let it be seen he
knows more than your hereditary legislator.</p>

<p>I cannot say that I was as much struck with the
peculiar advantages of the ladies over the rest of
their sex, as was the case with my Lord N——.
There were many pretty, and a few beautiful,
women present, but nothing of a very extraordinary
nature. The Princess Lieven, who is a mirror of
fashion, was among them. She looked more like
an American woman, than most of the others.</p>

<p>I was a little amused with two or three whom I
knew, and who evidently watched my manner,
with the idea of detecting provincial surprise at the
splendour and beauty by which I was environed.
The expectation was too obvious to be mistaken.
As respects the magnificence, it was certainly a
great deal beyond any thing we have, and as certainly
as much below a great deal I had seen on
the continent. As an American, perhaps, I ought to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
have been astonished, though certainly not as a
traveller.</p>

<p>The house was spacious, without being remarkably
so; the furniture and fixtures were comfortable
and heavy, rather than tasteful and rich; and the
whole entertainment, the mean approach excepted,
was as much respectable as magnificent. As for the
company, I saw nothing unusual in its appearance.
There may have been certain conventional signals
and forms that rendered it peculiarly agreeable to
those who were in the secret; but, judging it by
those general laws that are supposed to regulate the
intercourse of the refined and polished, it struck
me as being <i lang="fr">tant soit peu</i> below the tone of one or
two <i lang="fr">salons</i> I have entered in Paris. Of course,
there was no vulgarity, no noise, and a good deal of
ease, and much good sense; but there was a slightly
apparent self-felicitation and enjoyment, in a good
many, that a little too plainly betrayed a consciousness
that they were in —— house.</p>

<p>I was a little annoyed by the curiosity to see how
an American would be struck with the wonders,
and may have attributed this feeling to some who
did not entertain it; but still I should say, that
while there was possibly less acting on the score of
personal vanity and from individual motives, than
there would have been among the same number of
French people of rank, there was a good deal more
of it, from the exultation of belonging to a set so
particularly exclusive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>There was present a young Duke of ——, with
his wife on his arm; a lady old enough to be his
mother. She was a dark Spanish-looking woman,
well preserved, and with the remains of great
beauty. I thought the faces of your sex less English
than common, a circumstance which may have
been owing, however, to the <i lang="fr">coiffures</i>, which were
generally French. The <i lang="fr">toilettes</i> were rich and
handsome, of course; but it is a fact, I think, beyond
cavil, that the women of London do not dress as well
as their fair rivals, on the other side of the channel;
and I can only account for it, by the English lady’s
maid wanting the tact and taste of her French competitor;
for, half the time, the peculiarity is observable
at Paris, even, where both parties have access
to the same <i lang="fr">artistes</i>.</p>

<p>I went away early, and alone, the latter circumstance
occasioning a mistake almost as ludicrous as
that which accompanied the well-known Philadelphia
experiment in announcing. There is a woman
of fashion, here, a Countess ——, whose husband’s
title is the same as his name, which is the same as
our own in sound, though not in spelling. The
latter having been varied by one of those caprices
that have converted St. Maur into Seymour, and,
according to Sir William of that Ilk, Pepin into
Draper. I gave my name to the groom of the
chambers, on leaving the rooms, and at my request,
he called for Mr. ——’s servant, for I had ordered
little Smith to be in waiting with a cloak, intending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
to walk home, the distance being trifling. The first
servant on the stairs, however, accustomed to the
title of my fair namesake, and aware that she was
in the rooms, called out, in a loud voice, for “Lady
——’s people.” This cry preceded me, and when
I reached the <em>caucus</em>, I found two powdered and
liveried lackies ready to cover me with shawls and
cloaks! I declined their good offices, but begged
one of them to call Mr. ——’s man. The little
fellow made his appearance, amid the sneers and
laughter of his taller peers, who seemed to regard
his powdered poll, and lack of inches, much as
the peacocks regarded the finery of the daw.</p>

<p>I went one evening lately, to three balls, a
mode of comparing sets, that I have always found
useful in getting accurate notions of the ways of the
world. As a brief account of what I saw, may not
only amuse you, but serve to give you an idea of
how these things are managed here, it shall not be
withheld.</p>

<p>The first visit was to a rich merchant, who had
risen in the world by his own enterprise, and who
had finally come to keep what might be called
a pretty good house. The style of building was
much the same as that which prevailed in New
York among genteel people, some thirty years
since, with the exception that there was no stoup.
The drawing-rooms were up one flight of steps,
that in front occupying the whole width of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
building. This is a fashion almost as general here,
with the exception of the great houses, as the two
rooms and folding doors, at home.</p>

<p>The mistress of this house was <ins class="corr" id="tn-54" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'nervous, fidgetty'">
nervous, fidgety</ins>, and uneasy lest every thing should be not quite as
elegant as she desired. I had not been in the room
five minutes, before she whispered to me her great
sorrow that the <em>Honourable</em> Mrs. Somebody had not
been able to come, on account of some distressing
event; this being positively the first time, in my
life, I had ever heard of the honourable personage.
There is a class here, that make almost as much use of
this word, as the editors who come from New England.
The company was exactly what you would
suppose it to be when the presence or absence of
an <em>honourable</em> Mrs. Somebody was a matter of
moment.</p>

<p>From this house I went to another, in the neighbourhood,
for the mercantile people, who aim at
fashion, now live altogether at the west end, where
I found very much the same sort of dwelling, but
very different company. The mistress of this
house, was an American, married to an Englishman
of a good estate, and of respectable standing. Here I
met with honourables and right honourables, enough;
no one appearing to care any thing about them. I
should absolutely have nothing to say concerning
this ball, which was just like any other ball in a
respectable house, did I not feel bound to add that
I was much struck with the beauty of the young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
women, the neatness of their attire, and the accuracy
and lady-like manner of their dancing. The
quadrilles did not equal those of the Russian embassy,
at Paris, already mentioned, it is true; for
there was neither the numbers, nor the space, and
possibly not the instruction necessary to produce
an exhibition of this nature, equal to what one sees
in Paris; but they were very graceful, and, what
may appear to you as heterodox, quite equal in
beauty to what one sees in New York or Washington.</p>

<p>I was looking at the dancers, when an English
acquaintance observed, that he had lately met with
a young American at a ball, and “really he could
not see that she did not dance quite as well as the
English girls about her.” You will judge of the
effect this produced on me, when I tell you, it
was said, just as I had silently come to the conclusion
that the English girls had, at last, learned to
dance <em>nearly</em>, if not absolutely as well, as our own!</p>

<p>This may serve to give you some notion how
accurately nations understand each other’s peculiarities.
Since my sojourn in Europe, it has been
my good luck to witness the triumph of one American,
on a scene far superior to any thing that usually
offers in London. I shall not name the place, nor
even the country, but it was at a ball given by a
woman of royal birth. The palace was magnificent;
and the company, the first in Europe. There were
present fifteen or twenty royal personages, or those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
who were closely allied to monarchs, and nearly
half in the room were of the titular rank, at least,
of princes. I remember there was the heir to an
English dukedom among others, and he attracted
no more attention than any ordinary young man.
A young American girl was invited to stand up in
the set of honour. Her quiet, simple, feminine, lady-like
dancing, coupled with the artless ingenuousness
of a sweet countenance, in which mind was
struggling with natural timidity and the reserve of
good breeding, caused her, even in that assembly, to
be instantly an object of universal admiration. As
I stood in the crowd, unknown, I overheard the
comments, which were general on every side of
me. “Who is it?” was the first question; and
when some one told her name and country, I heard
no exclamation of surprise, that an American
should be a lady, or know how to dance. In the
course of the evening, it is true, twenty compliments
were paid me on the grace and deportment
of my young countrywomen in general, for it was
inferred, at once, that they had seen a specimen of
the nation!</p>

<p>From the house of Mrs. ——, who, herself, is
far more creditable to us, than many who figure in
the periodicals, showing her adopted countrywomen
in what the true virtues of your sex consist,
by being a model for a wife and mother, while she
has cleverness and spirit, I went to that of a Lord
C——. Although I was now under a patrician<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
roof, I saw no sensible difference in the building.
Even the merchant was as well lodged as the peer,
and all three of the houses had precisely the same
wearisome monotony as our own. After the taste
and variety of the dwellings on the continent of
Europe, you may imagine how dull and fatiguing
it is to enter twenty houses of a morning, and find
precisely the same internal arrangement. They
appear to me to be constructed like the coffins one
sees in our streets, for some particular market, differing
in sizes to suit, not the persons, but the
purses, of customers, and, being put one in another,
sent away for sale.</p>

<p>The company at Lord C——’s, was much the
same as that at Mrs. ——’s. It was generally well
bred and well toned, and, in the principal drawing-room,
where the quadrilles were in motion, I saw no
difference, beyond that which belongs to personal
peculiarity. There were the same pretty faces, the
same fine, well-rounded forms, and the same regulated
and graceful carriage. Depend on it, the
English women will, sooner or later, dance as well
as yourselves. Good luck to Free Trade!</p>

<p>You will feel some desire to know how balls,
like the two last, will compare with balls of our
own. In London, the rooms are a little larger; the
music is much the same; the females, to a slight
degree, are better dressed, as to freshness, though
scarcely as well dressed as to taste; the men also, I
think, are a little better dressed. The attendance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
has much more style, and the refreshments are not as
good as with us. As to the essential point of deportment,
the distinctions are more obvious than one
could wish, especially among the men, and among
the very youthful of your own sex.</p>

<p>The young play a very different part in Europe
from that which is confided to them at home. On
the continent of Europe, though girls of condition
are now permitted to mingle a little with the world
previously to marriage, it is under severe restraint,
and with much reserve. The English have greater
latitude allowed them, though infinitely less, than is
granted with us. They still play a secondary part
in society, and are subjected to a good deal of
restraint. I should say that tone, reflection, and
perhaps necessity, impart more <i lang="fr">retenu</i> of manner
here, than it is common to see with us, though girls
of good families, certainly the daughters of good
mothers, at home, come pretty nearly up to the
level of English deportment. It is the <i lang="fr">pêle mêle</i> of
society, in towns that double their population in
fifteen years, that is so destructive of manners with us.
In the general scramble, no set remains long enough
in a prominent situation to form a model. The
growth of the country has this sin to answer for, as
well as many others that are imputed to the institutions.
In brief, then, a better manner prevailed
at these balls than is usually met with at ours. I
say usually, for I know exceptions in America, but
our present concern is with the rule. There was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
less noise, nothing of the nursery, and generally that
superiority of air, which is a natural consequence
of minds more scrupulously trained and cultivated,
and of a breeding subjected to laws more unyielding
and arbitrary. Do not whisper these opinions,
I beseech you, to any of your acquaintances, lest
they murder me.</p>

<p>In making these comparisons, however, I do not
wish to be misunderstood. I could fill a drawing-room,
even in New York, that Babel of manners,
with women who should do credit to any country.
The difficulty would not be to select, but to exclude.</p>

<p>I have certainly met with a few instances of the
exuberant manner among English women, but
never among the higher classes. A caste, or two,
lower in the social scale, it is not uncommon, and
there is a set in which it actually appears to be the
<em>mode</em>. Taking one example from this specimen of
the nation, I will describe her, in order that you
may know, not <em>whom</em>, but <em>what</em>, I mean.</p>

<p>Imagine a pretty woman, who will put herself in
the centre of the floor alone, <em>entertaining</em> two or
three men! She talks loud, laughs much, and has
altogether a most startling confidence about her;
she looks her companion full in the eye, with a
determined innocence that makes him feel like a
victim, and causes him to wish for a fan. This is
a decided garrison manner, and has little or no success
at London. Something like it might be seen
in the house to which I first went this evening, but
nothing like it, at the two others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>It ought to be said, that the young of both sexes
have greatly improved, of late years, in England.
The dandies, of whom you read in novels,
<ins class="corr" id="tn-60" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'have postively no'">
have positively no</ins> existence here, or if they have, it is
not among gentlemen. I have seen a great deal of
mannerism of deportment, in the secondary classes,
often to a disagreeable and ludicrous degree, but
nothing at all like the coxcombry that figures in the
descriptions of the works of fiction. The men, as a
whole, are simple, masculine in manner and mind,
and highly cultivated, so far as elegant instruction
goes. They fail in the knowledge that is practical,
though with a certain set, even with this, or that which
relates to things as they are connected with the
machinery of their own power, they are familiar
enough. Nearly all have travelled, and most read
four or five languages, though few speak any well
but their own. The same is true of your sex. I
have hardly ever heard the merits of a novel discussed
among them, and to the continental sentimentality
they seem to be utter strangers; but it is
apparent at a glance, that they understand better
things, and have had their minds highly disciplined.
Remember, unless, in specific cases, I allude always
to rules, and not to exceptions.</p>

<p>The English women are a little apt to strike an
American as, in a slight degree, less feminine than
his own countrywomen. There is something in the
greater robustness of their <em>physique</em> to give rise to
such a feeling, and I think they are, to a trifling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
extent, more pronounced in air. While they are
much more punctiliously polite, they are scarcely
as gracious. There is certainly less nature about
them, though there is more frankness of exterior.
All their conduct is rigidly regulated, and while
they give you their hands in the manner of friendship,
you do not feel as much at home, as with the
American, who does not even rise to receive you,
and who protects the extremities of her fingers, as
if they were not the prettiest in the world. While
the English woman would command the most
respect, the American would win most on your
feelings, in a general intercourse. I believe both to
be among the best wives and mothers, that the
world contains. The English aid nature, in all
things, while the Americans too often mar it. No
women do so much injustice to themselves, as the
latter; their singularly feminine exterior requiring
softness and mildness of voice and deportment, a
tone that their unformed habits have suffered to be
supplanted by the rattle of hoydens and the giggling
of the nursery. I have seen many a young American,
who has reminded me of a nightingale roaring.
It is a pity that they do not seek models among
the better society of their own country, instead of
the inferior sets of Europe.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="LETTER_XVIII">LETTER XVIII.<br>
<span class="fs70">TO RICHARD COOPER, ESQ., COOPERSTOWN, N. Y.</span></h2>


<p>Mr. —— has carried his kindness so far,
as to go with me on the Thames. It had been
our plan to row to Greenwich but the weather not
proving favourable, we determined to go as far as
London bridge, and return on foot through the city.
We took boat, accordingly, at Westminster stairs,
and went down with the tide.</p>

<p>The Thames is both a pretty and an ugly stream.
When full, it is a river of respectable depth and of
some width, but, at low water, above London
bridge, it is little more than a rivulet flowing amid
banks of slimy mud. The wherries in use are
well adapted to their work, in this part of the
river, but lower down they are not sufficiently protected
against the waves. Accidents very frequently
happen, though probably they are not out of proportion
to the number of boats that are constantly plying
in every direction. The principal danger is of
getting <ins class="corr" id="tn-62" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'atwhart the cables'">
athwart the cables</ins> of barges and ships, when
the strength of the current is very apt to cause a
wherry to fill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>As we went down with the tide, a pair of sculls
answered our purpose, for one can have oars or
sculls, at pleasure. The banks of the Thames,
above Westminster bridge, are quite pretty, and
above Chelsea, where the river flows through
fields, they may be said to be even more; the villas
on the shores, the windings of the current, and the
meadows, raising them almost to positive beauty.
But below Westminster bridge, little remains to be
admired, until you reach the sea. Though on a
larger scale, the navigable part of the river has a
strong resemblance to the Raritan below Brunswick,
being crooked, muddy, and bounded by
wet meadows. The latter has a small advantage in
scenery, however; the hills lying nearer to the
stream. The passage of the Kilns, also, has
frequently reminded me of the Thames below
London.</p>

<p>Within the town, itself, warehouses blackened by
coal-smoke, manufactories, timber-yards, building
and graving docks, and waterman’s stairs, principally
line the shores. There are no magnificent quays,
as at Paris, the shipping taking in and discharging
by means of lighters, except in the wet docks, of
which, however, there are now nearly sufficient to
accommodate all the shipping of the port that is
engaged in foreign trade. The Thames presents
a very different picture to-day, from what it did
when I first entered it, in the year 1806. At that
time the river was literally so crowded as to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
it a matter of great difficulty to get a ship through
the tiers. There were hundreds of galliots alone,
engaged in the trade from Holland, and this in a
time of vindictive warfare! It was the only place
I knew, which gave one a vivid impression of what
is meant by a forest of masts. Most of the docks
existed, too, at that time, and they were crowded
with vessels. I asked the waterman to-day, an
old man who remembered the river many years,
what he thought might be the visible difference
between the number of vessels in the port, during
the year 1806 and that of 1828, and he told me
fully half. My own eye would confirm this opinion.
The trade has gone to the out-ports; particularly
to Liverpool. With the commerce of the river
much of its life and peculiarities, it seems to me, have
departed. The <em>costumes</em> have disappeared: the
waterman have a less jolly manner, and even Jack
wears the bell-mouthed trowsers no longer. These
mutations are constantly going on in the world, but
the Thames left a vivid impression on my young
fancy, twenty-two years ago, and returning to it,
after so long an absence, they struck me with force,
and in some degree painfully.</p>

<p>Although the Thames is not the Seine, nor the
Arno, nor the Tiber, it has a picturesque and imposing
beauty of its own, especially between the bridges.
There is a gloomy grandeur in the affluence of the
dark objects, in the massive piles that cut the stream,
in the movement, and in the sombre edifices that line<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
the shores. Here and there a building remarkable
in history, or of architectural pretension, is seen, and
usually the dome of St. Paul’s is floating in the haze
of the back-ground. As for the bridges themselves,
they are not unsuited to the general sombre character
of the view, though I think them in bad taste as
to forms. There is an English massiveness about
them that is imposing, but they strike me as being
out of proportion heavy for the stream they span,
and unnecessarily solid. The arches, with the exception
of those of Southwark, are not sufficiently
elliptical for lightness and beauty. It would have
been a poetical and worthy thought to have made the
bridge at Westminster gothic. Southwark bridge
is of iron, and the open work impairs the effect of
its proportions, which are much the finest of any,
but could the sides be closed, it would be a succession
of bold and noble arches. Between Westminster Hall
and the custom-house, there are now
five of these heavy piles, viz. Westminster, Waterloo,
Southwark, Blackfriars, and London. Preparations
are making to rebuild the latter, and as London
has improved so much in nothing, of late years, as
in its public architecture, it is fair to suppose that the
new work will be more worthy of the capital of a
great empire than its predecessor; though, I dare
say, it will not be as much extolled, since nations, like
individuals, as their minds expand become less vain
of their knowledge than they were wont to be of
their ignorance. The London bridge of my nursery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
tales was but an indifferent specimen of national taste,
though lauded to the skies.</p>

<p>We passed the Temple gardens, and one or two
more belonging to private dwellings, before we got
to Blackfriars, after which no signs of vegetation
were visible. The Temple buildings are quaint and
interesting, and the gardens, as usual in this country,
spots of emerald, beautifully arranged.</p>

<p>We landed at London bridge, and my companion
had the good nature to point out to me the supposed
site of the Boar’s Head, in East Cheap.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It must
have been what the cockneys call a <em>rum</em> place, for
an heir-apparent to carouse in, and yet, Shakspeare,
who wrote in the century after that in which Henry
reigned, would scarcely have presumed to take so
much liberty with royalty, in an age like his,
without being sustained by pretty well authenticated
traditions, in favour of what he was doing.</p>

<p>Mr. —— threaded the narrow streets of this
part of the town, like one who knew them well,
kindly pointing out to me every object of interest that
we passed. I smiled as we went along the well-remembered
thoroughfares, for it was not possible to
avoid comparing the cultivated, celebrated, and refined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
man who gave himself this trouble, with an
individual who had first introduced me, twenty-two
years earlier, into the very same streets.</p>

<p>You must be sufficiently acquainted with family
events to know that I was once in the navy. At
that time, it was considered creditable as well as
advantageous to the young naval aspirant, to show
his mettle by going a voyage or two in a merchant
vessel, as a common mariner, before he was placed
on the quarter-deck of a man-of-war. This was my
course, and I had twice visited London, in the capacity
of a young tar, before I was eighteen, besides
making several other voyages. The first time I
came to London, it was fresh from college, a lad of
about seventeen. I had then been long enough at
sea to get a nautical air, and of course was confounded
with my shipmates of the fore-castle.
The oldest custom-house officer put on board
the ship had been a gentleman’s domestic, and he
was full of the lore of the servants’ hall. He soon
singled me out, and I was much edified, for a week,
with his second-hand anecdotes of great people, and
the marvels of the West-end. The first Sunday
after our arrival in dock, he proposed giving me
ocular proofs of the truth of his accounts, and we
sallied forth in company, he as Minerva, and I as Telemachus.
We passed over much of the ground now
passed over under the better guidance of Mr. ——
and it was amusing to me to note the difference in
the tastes and manner of my two cicerones. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
we approached the monument, the ex-valet stopped,
and with an important manner inquired if I had
ever heard of the great fire in London. I had,
luckily, for it singularly raised me in his estimation.
With due formalities, I was then introduced to the
place where it had broken out, and to the monument.
“That is what we call the monument,” said
Mr. ——, in his quiet way, glancing his eye at it,
as he turned away to show me the new Boar’s
Head. “This is the house of my Lord Mayor, and
that is the coach of one of the sheriffs,” said Mr.
Swinburne, for so was the custom-house officer named.
“Wren has been much praised and much censured
for this edifice,” observed Mr. ——, as we passed
beneath the massive walls. I was led by the ex-valet
down a narrow street into a quaint, old, gothic, edifice,
where, in a large hall, I was confronted with carved
monstrosities in wood, which I was told with much
chuckling were Gog and Magog. “That is a quaint
and rather remarkable building,” said the poet, as we
passed the head of the same street; “it is Guildhall;
you may know that it gets its name, from being used
by the guilds, or corporated companies of the city.”
“This is Bow-church, and those are the bells that
Whittington heard, as he was quitting Lunnun,”
observed the oracular Mr. Swinburne—“<em>You</em> were
born far enough from this place, to escape the imputation
of cockneyism,” remarked the poet, as
we trudged along. “There, that is St. Paul’s!”
cried Mr. Swinburne, with an awful emphasis, as
if he expected me to fall down and worship it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
“It was a great work to be executed by a single architect,”
the poet simply said, “and it has many
noble points about it; I think it has, at least, the
merit of simplicity.” He was right enough, as to
externals, but it wants unity of design, within.</p>

<p>In this way, then, I went along, with my present
companion, irresistibly tempted to compare his quiet,
unpretending manner, with the brimful importance,
and strutting ignorance of the guardian of the revenue.
One of the contrasts was so droll that I have
not yet forgotten it, though it is unconnected with any
of the historical monuments. Mr. Swinburne bristled
close up to me, when we had got nearer to the court
end, and putting his hand to his mouth, as we passed
a quiet old gentleman, he whispered ominously, “An
earl!”—“Do you see that person on the opposite
side of the street,” said the poet, within fifty yards of
the same spot—“it is Lord ——, known as the
husband of the handsomest woman in England, and
for nothing else.” I remember to have greatly
scandalized Mr. Swinburne, by one of my antics.
“Did you ever hear of such a man as John Horne
Tooke,” he inquired. “Certainly; what of him?”
“Why that is he who has just passed—the fellow
who looks like a half and half parson.” I turned in
my tracks, incontinently, and gave chase, for, at that
early age I was not insensible to the pleasure of looking
at celebrated men, and I had been taught to regard
Horne Tooke as a writer who had got the better
of Junius. Favored by the jacket and trousers
I passed several times round “the chace,” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
I believe at length attracted his attention, by my
manœuvres. He was an austere looking man, but
I fancied he was not displeased at such evident admiration.
As for Mr. Swinburne, he applied some
very caustic epithets to my folly, but I succeeded
in mollifying him by double doses of admiration for
his cockney wonders.</p>

<p>Some of the scenes that I had witnessed, in my
first visits to London, returned to my mind so forcibly
to-day, that it appeared as if I had gone back to
boyhood and the days of fun. We had in the ship
a gigantic fellow from Kennebunk, of the name of
Stephen Stimpson. He had been impressed into
the British navy, and when he joined us, had just
been discharged from a frigate called the Boadicea,
of the Boadishy, as he termed her, and (quite as a
matter of course) he hated England in his heart.
This man was particularly desirous of going to the
West-end with me, at a later day, having heard Mr.
Swinburne descant on the wonders to be seen there.
As we were walking up St. James’ street in company,
whither I had a great deal of trouble to get
him, for he was for philosophizing and speculating
on all he saw, and not a little for fighting, he came
suddenly to a halt. An elderly lady was walking
through the crowd followed by a footman, in a
mourning livery. The man carried a cane and wore
a cocked hat. Stephen watched this pair some time,
and then gravely wished to know why “that <em>minister</em>
kept so close in the wake of the old woman ahead of
him?” I explained to him who they were, but he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
scouted the idea. It was a regular “minister,” as
witness the cocked hat, the black coat and breeches,
and moreover the cane, and he was not to be bamboozled
by any nonsense about servants. I had to
let him follow the lady to her own residence, where,
as I had foretold, the “minister” took off his hat,
opened the door for his mistress, and followed her
into the house. It was many months before Stephen
ceased to speak of this. After all, the same <i lang="fr">promenade</i>
would excite almost as much astonishment in
Broadway, at this very moment.</p>

<p>At that time there was a stand of sedan-chairs, in
St. James’ street, near the spot where Crockford’s
club-house has since been erected. I had some difficulty
in getting him over this “shoal,” for after
laughing in the chairmen’s faces, he was for having
a ride, on the spot.</p>

<p>The ranger of the Green-park, usually a person of
rank, has a very pretty residence and garden, that
open on Piccadilly. As we passed its gate, on our
way to Hyde Park corner, a black footman was
standing at it, his master probably expecting company.
The negro was dressed in a rich <em>white</em> livery
pretty well garnished with silver lace, red plush
breeches, white silk stockings, a cocked hat, and his
head was powdered as white as snow. You may
imagine the effect such an apparition would be likely
to produce on my Kennebunk companion. As there
are no houses, but this of the ranger, on the park side
of Piccadilly, and comparatively few people walk
there, we had the black porter, for a little time, all to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
ourselves. It was with a good deal of persuasion
that I prevented Stephen from laying hands on the
poor fellow, in order to turn him round and examine
him. As it was, he walked round him himself,
dealing out his comments with particular freedom.
All this time, the negro maintained an air
of ludicrous dignity, holding himself as erect as a
marine giving a salute, and looking steadily across
the street. Among other things, Stephen suggested
that the fellow might be one of Mr. Jefferson’s
“niggers,” who had decamped with a pair of his
master’s nether garments! He was so tickled with
this conceit, that I succeeded in dragging him away
while he was in the humour. When we returned,
an hour or two later, the black had disappeared.</p>

<p>Stephen had a desire to enter the Green-park,
but I hesitated, for I had once been forbidden
admission to Kensington Gardens, on account of
wearing a roundabout. While we were debating
the point, a worthy citizen came up, and said—“Go
in, my lads; this is a free country, and
you have as much right there as the King.”
On this intimation we proceeded. “What queer
notions these people have of liberty,” observed
Stephen, drily. “They think it a great matter to
be able to walk in a field, and there they let a nigger
stare them in the face, with a cocked hat, red
breeches, silk stockings, laced coat, and powdered
wool!” I made my own reflections, too, for the
first perception I had of the broad distinction that exists
between political <em>franchises</em> and political <em>liberty</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
dates from that moment. Young as I then was, I
knew enough about royal <i lang="fr">appanages</i>, and the uses
of royal parks, to understand that the public entered
them as a favour, and not as a right; but had it been
otherwise, it would have left ground for reflection on
the essential difference in principle, that exists between
a state of things in which the community receive
certain privileges as concessions, and that in
which power itself is merely a temporary trust, delegated
directly and expressly by the body of the
people.</p>

<p>But I am permitting the scenes of boyhood, to
divert me from the present moment.</p>

<p>Mr. —— showed me the Blue-coat School, the
new General Post Office, and divers other places of
interest, among which was Newgate. The architecture
of the latter struck me as being unusually
appropriate, and some of its emblems as poetically
just, whatever may be the legal reputation of the
place on other points.</p>

<p>Pursuing our way down Ludgate-hill, my companion
turned short into the door of a considerable
shop. It was Rundle &amp; Bridges, the first jewellers
and goldsmiths of the world! England has probably
more plate, than all the rest of Europe united;
at least, judging by the eye alone, I think it would
so appear to a stranger, although her wealth in the
precious stones appears to be even less than that of
some of the smaller countries. One certainly sees
fewer jewels in society, although I am told the display<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
of diamonds at Court, is sometimes very great.
There are no public collections to compare with
those of the continent, and the severe, one might
almost say classical, purity of taste, which prevails in
the dress of the men here, must have an effect to
lessen the demand for jewels.</p>

<p>I was on the same sofa, at a ball in Paris, with
Prince ——, one of the richest men of the continent.
His arm lay on the back of the seat, in a way to
bring the hand quite near me. Every finger was
covered with jewels of price, some of them literally
having two or three, like the fingers of a woman.
A piece of soap would have done more to embellish
the hand, than all this finery. Directly before me
stood the Duke of ——, one of the richest nobles of
England. I took an occasion to look at him, as he
drew a glove. He had not even the signet-ring,
which it is now so very common to wear, but the
hand was as white as snow.</p>

<p>The shop of Rundle &amp; Bridges was large, but it
made a wholesale and affluent appearance, rather than
the brilliant show one meets with in Paris. As
Mr. —— was known we were received with
great attention and civility. One of the heads of the
establishment took us up stairs, into a more private
apartment, where we were shown many magnificent
things, and among others a good deal of the royal
plate which had been sent here to be cleaned. It
struck me, as a whole, that the same objection exists
to the taste of England, as respects her plate, that
exists in relation to almost all her works of art—its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
clumsiness. An English tureen is larger than a
French tureen; an English chair, an English plate,
an English carriage, even an English razor, are all
larger than common. The workmanship is quite
often better, but the forms are neither as classical,
nor as graceful. As respects the plate, its massiveness
may convey an idea of magnificence, but it is a
ponderous and, in so much, a barbarous magnificence
compared to that in which the beauty of the proportions,
or of the intellectual part, is made of more importance
than the mere metal. To the eye of taste a
vessel of brass may have more value than one of gold.</p>

<p>You can have no just notion of the affluence of the
shops of London, generally, in the article of plate.
Gold, silver-gilt, and silver vessels, are literally piled
in their vast windows, from the bottoms to the summits,
as if space were the only thing desirable. I
have seen single windows, in which, it struck me, the
simple metallic wealth was greater in amount, than
the value of the entire stock of our heaviest silversmiths.
I am certain we were shown, to-day, single
sets of diamonds that would form a capital for a large
dealer in America.</p>

<p>While I tell you the taste of the English plate is
not generally good, the cultivation of the fine arts
being still too limited to extend much of its influence
to the mechanical industry of the country, there are
some great exceptions. Flaxman, one of the first
geniuses of our times, a man perhaps superior to
Benvenuto Cellini, in the intellectual part of his particular
branch of art, was compelled, by the want of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
taste in the public and his own poverty, to make designs
for the silversmiths, for which he had been
fitted by early and severe study in Italy. Perhaps he
was really more successful in his sketches than in
his completer works. Had there been a dozen such
men in England, the tables of the British nobility
would have exhibited taste and beauty, as well as
magnificence.</p>

<p>Among the royal plate was a salver just finished,
which was beautiful, although the conceit was feudal
rather than poetical, and conveyed an idea very different
from that created by a sight of the steel-yards,
and weights, and other familiar objects of domestic
use, disinterred at Pompeii. The material was gold,
and the ornaments were the stars and other insignia
of the orders of chivalry which the present king is
entitled to wear. The star and garter of the first
English order was in the centre of the salver, drawn
in large figures, while the others were arranged on
the border, which was wide enough to receive them,
on a diminished, but still on a suitable scale. The
work resembled line engraving, and was done with
truth and spirit, though, after all, it was nothing but
a sort of <em>tailorism</em>. The history of the salver itself
was rather curious. The eastern kings have a practice
of enclosing their personal missives in tubes or
cases of gold, resembling the tin and copper cases
that are used to hold scrolls. In the course of a
century, so many of these golden cases had accumulated,
that George IV., who is a much greater prince
in such matters, than in others more essential, took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
a fancy to have them converted into this piece of
furniture.</p>

<p>I heard an anecdote the other day of this sovereign,
which shows he can at least bear contradiction,
and that on a point on which the nation itself is rather
sensitive. The Duke of Wellington made one of his
guests at dinner, and the conversation is said to have
turned on the different armies of Europe! “I think
it must be generally conceded,” observed the king,
“that the British cavalry is the best in Europe; is
it not Arthur?” for he is said to have the affectation
of calling the great man by his christian name, by
way of <em>illustrating</em> himself, it is to be supposed.
“The French is very good, sir,” was the answer of
a man who had seen a service very different from
that which figures in histories, novels, and gazettes.
“I allow that the French cavalry is good, but I say
that our own is better.” “The French cavalry is
very good, sir.” “I do not deny it; but is not ours
better?” “The French is <em>very</em> good, sir.” “Well,
I suppose I must knock under, since Arthur will have
it so.” You are to remember practical men say the
French cavalry is the best of modern times. Had
this anecdote came from a <i lang="fr">laquais de place</i>, I should
not have mentioned it.</p>

<p>Coming through Fleet-street, Mr. —— led me
into a court, where he had some business with a
printer. Here he told me I was in Bolt-court, celebrated
as having been that in which Johnson resided.
The place seemed now abandoned to printers.
Here I left my companion and returned home.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="LETTER_XIX">LETTER XIX.<br>
<span class="fs70">TO WILLIAM JAY, ESQUIRE.</span></h2>


<p>I was walking to a house where I was engaged to
dine, the other evening, when a fellow near me raised
one of the most appalling street cries it was ever the
misfortune of human ears to endure. The words
were “Eve-ning Cou-ri-er—great news—Duke of
Wellington—Evening Courier,” screeched without
intermission, in a tremendous cracked voice, and
with lungs that defied exhaustion. Such a cry,
bursting suddenly on one, had the effect to make
him believe that some portentous event had just
broke upon an astounded world. I stopped and was
about to follow the fellow, in order to buy a paper,
when another cry, in a deep bass voice, that harmonized
with the first in awful discord, roared from
the opposite side of the street, “Contradiction of
Evening Courier—more facts—truth developed—contradiction—Evening
Courier.” In this manner
did these raven-throated venders of lies roam the
streets, until distance swallowed their yells—worthy
agents of the falsehoods and follies of the hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>This little occurrence has brought to mind the
subject of the daily and periodical press, and
that of literature, in general, in England, and the
duty of communicating to you some of the facts
that have reached me in relation to all these
interests, which may have escaped one residing at a
distance, and who can only know them as they are
presented to the world, which is commonly under
false appearances.</p>

<p>I presume it is a general rule, that the taste, intelligence,
principles, tone, and civilization of a nation
will be reflected in its popular publications, which
will include the productions of its periodical press
of every variety. The only circumstance that will
qualify the operation of this law must be sought in
the institutions. If these are popular, the rule is
pretty absolute; since the press, by being addressed
to an average intellect, will be certain to remain on
a level with its constituency. Viewed in this light,
and compared with the rest of the world rather than
with moral and philosophical truths in the abstract,
the American press is highly creditable to the American
nation, corrupt, ignorant, and vulgar as so
much of it notoriously is. If, however, we look to
a higher standard, and consider the press as a means
of instruction, we find less to take pride in. The
first of these facts is owing less to the merits of the
public at home, than to the misfortunes of masses of
men in other countries; and the second to a system
which has created an average opinion that over-shadows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
all ordinary attempts to resist it. The prevailing
characteristic of America is mediocrity.</p>

<p>In England, though there are local political constituencies
of the lowest scale of reason and knowledge,
they exist as servants rather than as masters.
The press has no motive to address them, and of
course it aims at higher objects. But, while the
strictly political constituencies of England are
scarcely of any account in the action of the government,
there is a public opinion that may be termed
extra-constitutional, that is of great importance,
and which it is necessary to manage with tact and
delicacy. This common sentiment acts through various
channels, of which a single example will serve
to illustrate my meaning.</p>

<p>A rich man on ’change may not possess a single
political right, beyond his general franchises as a
subject. He has no vote, and so far as direct representation
is concerned, no power in the state.</p>

<p>This is the situation of thousands in England, for
while the government is strictly one of money, seats
in parliament being bought as notoriously as commissions
in the army, the system is one which does
not give money its power through qualifications,
but by a competition in large sums. But, while
this stock-jobber may have no vote, in a government
so factitious, so dependent on industry, so much in
debt, so willing to borrow, and so sensitive on the
subject of pecuniary claims, his <em>opinion</em> and goodwill
become matters of the last moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>I have selected this instance, because the worst
features of the English press are connected with the
mystifications, false principles, falsehoods, calumnies
national and personal, and flagrant contradictions
that are uttered precisely with a view to conciliate
the varying and vacillating interests that depend on
the fluctuations and hazards of trade, the public
funds, and all those floating concerns of life, which,
being by their very nature more liable to vicissitudes
than homely industry, most completely demonstrate
the truth of the profound aphorism which
teaches us that “the love of money is the root of all
evil.” It is not necessary to come to England to
seek examples of the effect of such an influence, for
our own city presses exhibit it, in a degree that is
only qualified by the circumstances of a state of society,
which, by being a good deal less complicated,
and less liable to derangement, calls for less watchfulness
and editorial ferocity.</p>

<p>As a whole, then, I should say the predominant
characteristic of the English press, is dependent on
the necessity of addressing itself to the support of
interests so factitious, so certain, sooner or later, to
give way, and, at the same time so all-important to
the power and prosperity of the nation, for the time
being. The struggles of parties are subservient to
these ends, on which not only party but national
power depend. If it has been said truly, that the
sun, in its daily course around the earth, is accompanied
by the roll of the British morning drum, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
might with equal justice have been added, and followed
by the sophisms to which interests so conflicting
are the parent.</p>

<p>In guarding these interests all parties unite. In
this respect there is no difference between the Times
and the Courier, the Edinburgh and the Quarterly.
They may quarrel with each other about the fruits
of these national advantages, which they proclaim to
be national rights, but they will quarrel with all
mankind to secure them to Great Britain. It must
be remembered that vituperation and calumny are
the natural resource of those who are weak in truth
and argument, as stones and clubs are the weapons
of children. A shameless, ill-concealed, national cupidity,
then, I take to be the predominant quality of
the English press. I do not mean that the man of
England is a whit more selfish than the man of
America, or the man of France, but that he lives in a
condition of high pecuniary prosperity, (always a
condition of peril) and under circumstances of constant
and peculiar jeopardy, that keep the evil passions
and evil practices of wealth in incessant excitement.</p>

<p>You know the mechanical appearance of the English
press already. There is much talent, mingled
with much vulgar ignorance, employed in the news
departments; the journals, in this particular, appearing
to address themselves to a wider range of tastes
and information, than is usual even with us. Many
of our journals, even in the towns, are essentially
vulgar, in their tone and language,
<ins class="corr" id="tn-82" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'adapting both both to'">
adapting both to</ins><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
the level of a very equivocal scale of tastes
and manners, but I do not remember ever to have
seen in an American journal of the smallest pretensions
to respectability, as low and as intrinsically
vulgar paragraphs as frequently are seen here, in
journals of the first reputation. The language of the
shop, such as “whole figure,” “good article,”
“chalking up,” “shelling out,” and other Pearl-street
terms, frequently find their way into the leading
articles of a New York paper, whereas those of
London are almost always worded in better taste;
but, on the other hand, one daily sees the meanest
and lowest cockneyisms, united with infamous grammar,
(not faults of hurry and inadvertency, but faults
of downright vulgarity) in the minor communications
of the English press. Of this quality are the
common expressions of “think of me (my) writing
a letter,” “he was agreeable (he agreed) to go,”
“I am recommended (advised) to stay,” &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is the fashion to extol the talents of the Times.
I have now been an attentive reader of this journal
for several years, and I must say its reputation strikes
me as being singularly unmerited. That it occasionally
contains a pretty strong article is true, for its
circulation would secure the casual contributions
of able men, but, as a whole, I rank it much below
several other journals in this country, and very much
below some in Paris. It is said this paper reflects
the times, and that its name has been given with a
view to this character. The simple solution of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
this is, I fancy, that the paper is treated as a property,
and that it looks to circulation more than to principles,
humouring prejudices with a view to popularity.
The mere calling of names, and the bold vituperation,
for which the Times is notorious, does not
require any talent, though nothing is more apt to
impose on common understandings. The Morning
Chronicle appears to me to possess the most true
talent of any journal in London. This appearance,
however, may be owing to the fact of its espousing
liberal and just principles, for, unlike most of its contemporaries,
it has no need of resorting to sophisms
and laboured mystifications to maintain a state of
things which is false in itself; for it should never be
forgotten, in contemplating all the favourite theories
of England, that the argument has been adapted to
the fact, and not the fact to the argument.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I have
seen occasional articles from a journal called the
Scotsman, that appear to be written with the simple
straight-forward power of truth and honesty. There
is a lucid common sense about this paper, which
gives it a high place in the scale of the journals of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
the day. No article that I have ever met with in
either of these two papers betrays the cloven foot
of the pecuniary interests mentioned, though I cannot
take upon myself to say that they are entirely
free from the imputation. Still they have always
appeared to me to be conducted with too much talent,
to lend themselves to a practice that one would think
must offend the moral sense of every right-thinking
and right-feeling man.</p>

<p>Mr. Canning, not long before his death, openly
vaunted the moral influence of England, by way of
supporting his political schemes. Nothing is more
evident than the fact that the journals of this country
frequently admit articles that are intended to produce
an effect in other states. I think they over-estimate
their influence, however, for I do not believe that
the opinion of England has any material power, except
in America. As a people the English are
not liked on the continent of Europe, and I think
the disposition is rather to cavil at their truths, than
to receive their fallacies. The aristocracy of England
has a great influence, by its wealth, power, and
style, on the <em>desires</em> of all the other European aristocracies,
which very naturally wish themselves to
be as well off, but the dogmas of this school would
hardly do for the daily journals. I do not say that
the English press totally overlooks this class and its
interests; on the contrary, it does much to sustain
both, but it is by indirect means, and not by argument,
or by appeals to the passions. It tells of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
liberal acts of individuals of the body, recapitulates
the amount of rent that has been remitted to the
tenantry, and the number of blankets that has been
distributed to the poor. The left hand is studiously
made to know what the right hand has done in this
way, among the great and noble, while the charities
of the more humble are usually permitted to pass in
silence. Not satisfied with this, the world is regularly
enlightened on the subject of the large entertainments
given by the great, the names of the
guests, and not unfrequently with the dresses of the
women. The ravenous appetite of the secondary
classes to know something of their superiors, is fed
daily in this extraordinary manner, (the practice
exists nowhere else, I believe,) and thousands of
dreamy bachelors and prim maidens, pass their days
in the high enjoyment of contemplating at a distance,
the rare felicities of a state of being to which
a nearer approach is denied them, and which a nearer
approach would destroy.</p>

<p>I remember when I came to London in 1826, to
have laughed at an account of the manner in which
Lord A., and Lady B., and Sir Thomas C., had
passed their mornings, with the usual gossip of fashionable
life that the article contained, when an
American who had been some time in England,
gravely assured me that there were thousands in the
nation, who would not buy the paper were this momentous
stuff omitted. There have been books, for
a very long time, which contain the pedigrees, titles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
creations, and family alliances of the peers, and
which furnish mental aliment for hundreds of devout
admirers of aristocracy. These books, which are
useful enough in a certain way, when it is remembered
that the peers control the first empire of modern
times, have been extended to the baronets and
knights, and latterly to the gentry of the country.
The whole forms a curious study, when one is disposed
to ferret out the true principle of the government,
and the modes by which families have attained
power,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> but they are read with avidity, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
England, as a means of holding an intercourse with
beings, who, as respects the mass, form quite another
order of creation.</p>

<p>But if the journals, in this manner, contribute to
support the aristocracy by feeding these morbid
cravings of the excluded, they do more towards
overturning it, just now, by their open and rude
attacks. I do not say, that I have ever met with
an Englishman, who is not, in some degree, under
the influence of the national deference for nobility,
for to be frank with you, I can <ins class="corr" id="tn-88" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'scarcely recal'">
scarcely recall</ins> twenty Americans, who are exempt from the same
weakness; but there are a good many who, by
drawing manfully on their reason and knowledge,
are enabled to detect the fallacies of the system,
and who do not scruple to expose them in the public
journals. These men, of whom I may have
made the acquaintance of a dozen, remind me of
the lasting influence which the ghost stories of the
nursery produce on the human mind. We drink
in these tales eagerly in childhood, and, in after
life, though reason and reflection teach us their absurdity,
few of us go through a church-yard in a
dark night, without fancying that its sheeted tenants
may rise from their graves. Thus do the
boldest of the English, when philosophising the
most profoundly on the wrongs and inexpediency
of aristocratic rule, look stealthily over their shoulders,
as if they saw a lord! You may judge of the
profoundness of the impression, here, by its remains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
in America. Certainly, the mass of the
American people, care no more for a lord, than
they care for a wood-chuck; perhaps, also the feeling
of the real gentry of the country, is getting to be very
much what it ought to be, on such a subject, seeing
no more than a man of the upper classes of another
country, in an English nobleman; but take the class
immediately below those who are accustomed to
our highest associations, and there is still a good
deal of the sentiment of the tailor, in their manner
of contemplating an English nobleman. Alas! it
is much easier to declare war, and gain victories in
the field, and establish a political independence,
than to emancipate the mind. Thrice happy is it
for America, that her facts are so potent, as to be
irresistable; for were our fate left to opinion, I fear
we should prove ourselves to be any thing but philosophers.</p>

<p>It will not be doing justice to the English press,
if we overlook its disposition to indulge in coarse,
national, and personal vituperation. The habit of
resorting to low, personal abuse, against all who
thwart the views of their government, or who have
the manliness to promulgate their opinions of the
national characteristics, let it be done as honestly,
as temperately, or as justly as it may, is too well
known to admit of dispute. It may be a natural
weakness in man, to attempt to ridicule his enemies,
but the English calumniate them. They calumniated
every distinguished man of our revolution; no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
general can gain a victory over them, and escape
their vituperation; and the moral enormities attributed
to Napoleon, had their origin in the same
national propensity. Some of the English, with
whom I have spoken on this subject, while they
have admitted this offensive trait in their press, have
ascribed it to the morality of the nation, to whose
wounded sensibilities, the abuse is addressed! This
is very much like imputing uncharitableness to sins,
to a Christian conscience. Certainly, I am no vindicator
of the personal, or political, ethics of Napoleon.
As respects his morals, I presume, they
were very much like those of other Frenchmen of
his time and opportunities, but if the sensibilities
of England, were so exaggerated, on such subjects,
why did they go abroad in quest of examples to
scourge? I doubt, if there be any thing worse in the
private career of Napoleon, than the intrigue with
the “Fair Quaker,” in that of George III., or any
thing approaching that, which every well-informed
man here tells me, is the present condition of the
court of Windsor. Did you ever hear the familiar
French song of Malbrook?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Malbrook s’en va t’en guerre.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">etc.      etc.      etc.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Malbrook, you know, was the Duke of Marlborough,
and the song is the French mode of revenging
the nation, for the manifold floggings it received<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
at his hands. The wisdom of thus killing an enemy
in doggerel, whom they could neither slay, nor
defeat, may be questioned, but imagine, for a moment,
that Wellington, and his fortunes had been
French, and then fancy the abuse he would have
received. I never yet met with a Frenchman, who
had not a most sincere antipathy to the Duke of
Wellington; they tell fierce stories about the Bois
de Boulogne, and other similar absurdities, the
outbreakings of the mortified pride of a military
people, but I never yet saw, or heard a personal
calumny against him, in France, unless it was
connected directly with his public acts. They say,
he permitted the terms of the capitulation of Paris,
to be violated; but they do not enter into his private
life, to villify the man. I have, sometimes, been
afraid, this tendency to blackguardism, was “Anglo-Saxon,”
for it manifests itself in our own journals,
more particularly among the editors of New England,
who, if they have more of the sturdy common
sense, and masculine propensities of the Fatherland,
than their more southern contemporaries, have
also the coarse-mindedness. I have industriously
sought the cause of this peculiarity, and at one time,
I was disposed to attribute it to a low taste in the
mass of the nation, which I again ascribed to the
effects of the institutions, just as with us, the strongest
term of reproach among the blacks, is for one to
call his fellow, a “nigger;” but observation has
convinced me, that this national taste is only secondary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
as a cause. The press now caters to it, it is
true, but it first created it. I believe, its origin is
to be found in the vulgarity inherent in the active
management of capricious commercial interests, the
factitious state of the national power, and the genuine
and unaffected outbreakings of a pecuniary
cupidity. Look at home, and you will see the
presses under the control of those, who have the
management of floating interests, tainted by the
same vice. “The love of money, is the root of all
evil,” and the propensity to blackguard those who
thwart the rapacity of the grasping, is one of its
most innocent enormities.</p>

<p>I think it very evident, that there is much writing
in this country, that is especially intended for
“our market.” The English, who control the reviews
and journals, are fully aware of the influence
they wield over the public mind in America, and
you may be quite certain, that a nation, whose very
power is the result of combination and method,
does not neglect means so obvious to attain its ends.
There is scarcely a doubt, that articles, unfavourable
to America, low, blackguard abuse that was addressed
to the least worthy of the national propensities
of the English, were prepared under the
direction of the government, and inserted in the
Quarterly Review. Mr. Gifford admitted as much
as this, to an American of my acquaintance, who
has distinctly informed me of the fact. I presume
the same is true, in reference to the daily press.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
Some fifty paragraphs have met my eye, since I
have been here, in which the writers have pretty
directly exulted in their power over the American
mind. This power is wielded to advance the interests
of England, and, as a matter of course, to
thwart our own. It probably exceeds any thing of
which you have any idea. Whether the English
government actually employs writers about our
own presses or not, at present, I cannot say, but it
has, unquestionably, agents of this sort, on the
continent of Europe, and I think it highly probable
that it has them in America.</p>

<p>We talk of the predestination of the Turks, but
I question if the earth contains a people who so
recklessly abandon their dearest, and most important
interests, so completely to chance, as ourselves.
Both the government and the people, appear to me,
to trust implicitly to Providence for their future
safety, abandoning even opinion to the control of
their most active enemies, and shamelessly deserting
those who would serve them, unless they happen
to be linked with the monster, party. The chief of
a political faction may do almost any thing with
impunity, but he who defends his country, unconnected
with party, is abandoned to the tender mercies
of the common enemy. In this respect, we
are like the countryman in a crowd of pick-pockets,
full of ourselves, but utterly unconscious of our
risks.</p>

<p>The young Englishman who aspires to fortune<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
will select his object, and support it, or attack it,
as the case may be, with his pen. He will endeavour
to counteract democracy, to sustain the English
Free Trade system, to excite prejudice against
America, to arouse antipathy to Russia, to prove
France ought not to possess Antwerp, or, to uphold
some other national interest, and, if a clever man,
he is certain to be cherished by that government
and rewarded. Some of the most eminent men
England has produced, have forced themselves into
notice in this manner.</p>

<p>Let us fancy an American to run a similar career.
So little is the nation brought before the European
world that the chances are, as one hundred to one,
he would attract no notice here; but, we will
imagine him in possession of the ear of Europe,
and able to bring his matter before its bar. If
England were opposed in either her prejudices, or
interests, he would as a matter of course, be vituperated;
for whom did the English press ever spare,
under such circumstances? No doubt, a thousand
honest and generous pens would be ready to be their
countrymen’s vindicator; no doubt the government
would throw its broad mantle around its friend, and
manifest to the world its sense of its own dignity
and interests? No such thing; the abuse of the
English press would produce even more effect in
America than in England; its tales, however idle
or improbable, would be swallowed with avidity,
as tales from the capital circulate in the provinces,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
and, as for the government, it already has a character
here for confiding in those who openly repudiate
its principles! Well may it be said, that we
have reason to be thankful to God for our blessings,
for if God did not take especial care of us, we
should be without protection at all.</p>

<p>I have been much struck, here, with the little
impression that is made by the reviews. Exceptions
certainly exist, but the critical remarks that,
written here, produce no visible effect, would give
a work its character with us. Every body, that is
at all above the vulgar, appears to understand that
reviewing “is the great standing mystification of
the age.”</p>

<p>In making all these comparisons, however, we
are too apt to overlook the statistical facts of America.
A short digression will explain my meaning.
If we speak of the civilization of England in the
abstract, it is not easy to employ exaggerated terms,
for it challenges high praise; but when we come to
compare it to our own, we are to take the whole
subject in connection. Were the entire population
of the United States compressed into the single
state of New York, we should get something like
the proportions between surface and people, that
exist in England. In reflecting on such a fact, one
of the first things that strike the mind, is connected
with the immense physical results that
<ins class="corr" id="tn-95" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'are dependant on'">
are dependent on</ins> such a circumstance. The mean of the population<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
of New York for the last thirty years, has
been considerably below a million; but had it been
fourteen millions during the same period, leaving
the difference in wealth out of the question, how
little would even England have to boast over us!
Losing sight entirely of the primary changes that
<ins class="corr" id="tn-96" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'are dependant on'">
are dependent on</ins> a settlement, and which perhaps
seem to be more than they really are, we have
actually done as much in the same time as England,
in canals, rail-roads, bridges, steam-boats, and all
those higher modes of improvement, that mark an
advanced state of society. These are the things of
which we may justly be proud, and they are allied
to the great principle on which the future power and
glory of the nation are to be based. They are
strictly the offspring of the institutions.</p>

<p>We offer our weak side when we lay claim to
the refinements, tastes, and elegancies of an older, or,
in our case, it would be better to say, a more <em>compact</em>
condition of society. The class to which
these exclusively belong is every where relatively
small. I firmly believe it is larger with us, than
among the same number of people, in any other
country, though this opinion is liable to a good deal
of qualification. We know little or nothing of
music, or painting, or statuary, or any of those arts
whose fruits must be studied to be felt and understood;
but, in more essential things, we have even
sometimes the advantage; while in others, again,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
owing to our colonial habits of thought, we have
still less reason to be proud.</p>

<p>To apply these facts to our present subject, you
will easily understand the manner in which a nation
so situated will feel the influence of opinions
of an inferior quality. In all communities men
will defer to actual superiority, when it acts steadily
and in sufficient force to create a standard. Unluckily
manners, tastes, knowledge, and tone are
all too much diffused in America to make head
against the sturdy advances of an overwhelming
mediocrity. As a basis of national greatness, this
mediocrity commands our respect, but it is a little
premature to set it up as a standard for the imitation
of others. It even over-shadows, more particularly
in the towns, the qualities that might better be its
substitute. Its influence on the whole is genial, for
so broad a foundation will, sooner or later, receive
an appropriate superstructure, but, <i lang="la">ad interim</i>, it
places a great deal too much at the disposal of empirics
and pretenders. This is the reason (coupled
with the deference that the provinces always show
to the capital) why reviews and newspaper strictures
produce an effect in America, of which they
entirely fail in England. Here the highest intellectual
classes give reputation, while in America
it is derived from the mediocrity I have mentioned,
through the agency, half the time, of as impudent
a set of literary quacks as probably a civilized country
ever tolerated. There are as flagrant things of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
the sort perpetrated here, as in America, but their
influence is limited to the milliners and shop-men. A
national <em>prejudice</em> may take any shape, in England,
for no one is exempt from the feeling, from the
king on his throne to the groom in his stable; but,
keeping this influence out of sight, the standard of
taste and knowledge is too high, to be easily imposed
on.</p>

<p>Some one has said, with more smartness than truth
perhaps, so far as one’s own contemporaries are
concerned at least, “that no author was ever written
down except by himself.” Many an author
however, has been temporarily written <em>up</em> by
others. I have just had a proof of this truth.</p>

<p>A work has lately appeared here, of rather more
pretension than common. This book is deemed a
failure in the literary circles of London. Of its
merits I know nothing, not having read it, but in
the fact, I cannot be mistaken, for I have heard it
spoken of, by every literary man of my acquaintance,
from Sir Walter Scott down; and but one
among them all, has spoken well of it, and he, notoriously
a friend of the author, “damned it with faint
praise” more than any thing else. The bookseller
paid too much for the manuscript, however, to put
up with a loss, and a concerted and combined effort
has been made to write the book up. In England
these puffs, which are elaborate and suited to a
grave subject, have had no visible effect, while I
see, by the journals at home, that the work in question
is deemed established, on this authority!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>I am told that the practice of writers reviewing
themselves, is much more prevalent here than one
would be apt to suspect. One can tolerate such a
thing as a joke, but it is ticklish ground, and liable
to misconstruction. But man loves mystification.
The very being who would bristle up and resent a
frank, manly vindication of a writer that should
appear under his own name, would permit his judgment
to be guided by the same opinions when
produced covertly, nor would the modesty of the
author, who glorifies himself in this sneaking manner,
be half as much called in question, as that of
him who, disdaining deceit, and met his enemies
openly!</p>

<p>There is less of simulated public opinion in the
English press than in our own, I presume; owing
to the simple fact, that public opinion is neither so
overwhelming nor so easily influenced. The constant
practice of appealing to the public, in America,
has given rise to the vilest frauds of this character,
that are of constant occurrence. When it is wished
to induce the public to think in a particular way,
the first step is to affect that such is already the
common sentiment, in the expectation that deference
to the general impression will bring about
the desired end. I have known frauds of this
nature, connected with personal malice, which, if
exposed, would draw down the indignation of every
honest man in the nation, on those who practised
them; some of whom now pass for men of fair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
characters. It is scarcely necessary to say that
such fellows are thieves in principle.</p>

<p>There is another all-important point on which,
in the spirit of imitation, we have permitted the
English press to mislead us. Nothing can be more
apparent, in a healthful and natural state of the
public mind, that a lie told to influence an election,
or to mislead on a matter of general policy, ought
to be just so much the more reprobated than a lie
that affects an individual merely, as the concerns of
a nation are more engrossing and important than
the concerns of a private citizen. In America, an
election ought to be, and in the main it is, an expression
of the popular will for great national
objects; in England, it is merely a struggle for
personal power, between the owners of property.
The voter with us, is one of a body which controls
the results; in England, he is one of a body controlled
by direct personal influence. No greater,
ordinary crime, against good morals and the public
safety, can be committed, than to mislead the public
in matters of facts connected with an election;
and yet an “electioneering lie,” is almost deemed
a venial offence in America, because they are so
deemed here, where, as a rule, every thing is settled
by direct personal influence and bribery.</p>

<p>Some very false notions exist in America, on the
subject of the liberty of the press. We give it by
far too much latitude, perhaps not so much in the
law itself, as by opinion and in the construction of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
the law. The leaning is in favour of publication;
firstly, because man is inherently selfish, and he cares
little what private wrongs are committed in feeding
the morbid appetites of the majority; and, secondly,
by confounding a remedy with diet. When power
is to be overturned, the press becomes a sure
engine, and its abuses may be tolerated, in order to
secure the inestimable advantages of liberty; but
liberty attained, it should not be forgotten, that
while arsenic may cure a disease, taken as daily
food it is certain death. Every honest man appears
to admit that the press, in America, is fast getting
to be intolerable. In escaping from the tyranny of
foreign aristocrats, we have created in our bosom
a tyranny of a character so unsupportable, that a
change of some sort is getting to be indispensable
to peace. Truth appears to be no longer expected.
Nor is this all. An evident dishonesty of sentiment
pervades the public itself, which is beginning to
regard acts of private delinquency with a dangerous
indifference; and acts, too, that are inseparably
connected with the character, security, and a right
administration of the state; political jockeyship
being now regarded very much as jockeyship of
another order is notoriously esteemed by those who
engage in it. In this respect, England has the
advantage of us, for here the arts of politics are
exercised with greater <i lang="fr">ménagement</i>, being confined
to the few; whereas, in America, acting on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
public, they require public demoralization to be
tolerated.</p>

<p>In ferocity and brutality I think the English
press, under high excitement, much worse than our
own; in general tone and manliness, greatly its
superior. In both cases the better part of the community
is exposed to the rudest assaults from men
who belong to the worst. In England, the public
is generally spared the impertinence of personal,
editorial controversies, a failing of rusticity, and the
press is but little used for the purposes of individual
malice; while in America, it is a machine, half the
time, which, under the pretence of serving the
public, in addition to pecuniary profit, is made to
serve the ambition, or to gratify the antipathies, of
the editor, who obtains, through its use, an importance
and power he could, probably, never obtain
in any other manner. This distinction is a consequence
of presses being stock-property in England,
which is not owned by the editors; while in America,
the man who writes is master of the limited
establishment. It is his machine of personal advancement.</p>

<p>There is one point connected with this subject,
on which we admit a degradation unknown to all
other countries. Every community is obliged to
submit to the existence of its own impurities, but we
imbibe those which are generated in the most factitious
and high-wrought, and, consequently, the
most corrupt state of society, in christendom. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
is another of the evils arising from a want of pride
and national character, the people which is thrown
into convulsions by the worthless strictures of any
foreign traveller, on their elegance and tastes, permitting
the very putridity of foreign corruption to
fester in and pollute its bosom!</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="LETTER_XX">LETTER XX.<br>
<span class="fs70">TO JAMES STEVENSON, ESQ., ALBANY, N. Y.</span></h2>


<p>All this time, the business of eating and drinking
goes on. There is, indeed, too much of it for
me; the late hours, and the small, heated, and
crowded rooms of London, compelling me to
decline a good deal more than half the civilities
that are offered. One thing has struck me, as at
least odd. Coming, as I did, into this country,
without letters, (those sent by Mr. Spenser, excepted,)
I had no right to complain, certainly, had
I been permitted to go away entirely without a
visit; but I have been noticed by more than I had
the smallest right to expect; and yet, among all
those who have knocked at my door, I am by no
means certain there is a single tory! I except the
case of Sir Walter Scott, for we were previously
acquainted. As we met first in society, the attention
was, perhaps, necessary on his part, though I
am far from supposing he would have thought himself
bound to cut me because I am an American, although
I have some reason for thinking that even he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
does not view us with very friendly eyes.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> I do not
know the political opinions of Mr. Sotheby, though
he is evidently too mild a man to feel strong
antipathies on this account; but, I believe, these
two excepted, not only every man who has visited
me, or asked me to his house, and nearly every
man whom I have met at dinners and breakfasts,
has been a whig! Is this accident, or is it really
the result of feeling?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>I have dined in the last month, among other
places, twice at Lansdowne-house, and once with
Lady ——, who lives in good style here, and
keeps a better sort of table, though a widow.
Her house was very much like all the second class
houses here, with a dining-room below, and the
drawing-rooms on the first floor, being a little larger
than a second class American town residence!</p>

<p>At table, we had two or three members of the
lower house, a Frenchman, and myself. The conversation
turned, after the mistress of the house
had retired, on the French revolution, which was
discussed, with all the usual allusions to national
character, ferocity, levity, and jacobinism, just as
cooly as if a Frenchman did not make one of the
company. The poor fellow sat on thorns the whole
time, keenly alive to the awkwardness of his situation,
and looking hard at me, the only one who
did not join in the discourse, and the only one who
appeared to remember his existence.</p>

<p>This indifference to the feelings of others, is a
dark spot on the national manners of England. The
only way to put it down, is to become belligerent
yourself, by introducing pauperism, radicalism,
Ireland, the Indies, or some other sore point. Like
all who make butts of others, they do not manifest
the proper forbearance, when the tables are turned.
Of this, I have had abundance of proof, in my
own experience. Sometimes, these remarks are
absolutely rude, and personally offensive, as a disregard
of one’s national character, is a disrespect to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
his principles, but as personal quarrels on such
grounds, are to be avoided, I have uniformly retorted
in kind, if there was the smallest opening for
such retaliation. Sometimes, the remarks are the
result of kind feelings, and a misapprehension of
facts, when I have always endeavoured to set the
matter right. All foreigners complain of the English,
in this respect; though so far as my little
experience goes, I think, in general, the very
highest classes do not merit the opprobrium they
receive on this account, although extraordinary
things of the sort are told of even them. Down
as low in the social scale, as the third or fourth sets,
the commercial classes in particular, the failing
amounts almost to intolerance.</p>

<p>We, that is to say, the men, were still at Lady
——’s table, when the raps at the front door, announced
evening company. It is necessary to understand
the eloquence of a London knocker, to
appreciate the melody that followed. Two or three
messages were sent to the guest most at home, to
summon us to the drawing-room, but the French
revolution was in the way. At length, we got rid
of the bloody tragedy, and mounting to the first
floor, found a room already full of company.</p>

<p>I had the honour of being introduced to Lady
——, who came nearer to a dandy in petticoats in
her manner, than any woman I ever met with. I
can only liken her apparent affectations of speech,
to those one sometimes hears on the stage; a lisping,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
drawling superciliousness, that may be understood,
but cannot be described. She is the only instance
I have yet met with, of an English woman of rank,
who had not an unpretending, simple manner of
utterance, for most of them speak the language, not
only well, but with a quiet dignity, that is very
agreeable. Indeed, I should say, the women of
this country, as a rule, speak with great precision
and beauty, though they often appear cold and repulsive.</p>

<p>A countrywoman of ours, at ——, was always
talking of this Lady ——. Of course, I supposed
they were intimate, the official characters of their
husband’s bringing them necessarily much together.
I alluded, therefore, to Mrs. ——, as one of her acquaintances.
“——” “——,” she repeated, with
that exquisite lisp of hers, “I do not think I know
them.” I wish I could impart to paper, the consummate
affectation of her manner, as she said this, for
it was quite as admirable in its way, as the coolness
with which she denied an acquaintance, that I was
certain, in the nature of things, she could not
readily have forgotten. I was soon tired of this, and
stole away at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>There was at table to-day, Mr. —— ——, the
—— —— ——. He is a distinguished commoner,
a member of parliament, and a rich landholder.
I was surprised to find, this person speaking
very much in the worst <em>drawing-room</em> manner, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
our New England dialect. I do not mean, that he
said “dooze” and “ben,” and “nawthin,” for his
pronunciation was not amiss, but he had the mean
intonation, and sing-song utterance, that we so well
understand in America. I should have pronounced
him one of us, in a minute, had I not known who
he was. This is the second instance of the kind, I
have met with here. <i lang="fr">Au reste</i>, he was a benevolent,
sensible, modest man, and, as I thought,
without prejudice against America. I love such
Englishmen.</p>

<p>I have breakfasted, lately, with <ins class="corr" id="tn-109" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Sir James M‘Intosh'">
Sir James Macintosh</ins>, Mr. Sharp, Mr. —— ——; and two or three
others. At the house of the first, I met Mr. Winn,
a prominent whig; and at the latter’s, we were
the host, Lord S——, Sir —— ——, and myself.
Mr. Rogers was also present, on most of these occasions.
At Mr. Sharp’s, were Lord ——, a young
tory for a novelty, and Lord ——, a lad, who is the
heir of Lord L——. I had seen the former in
Paris.</p>

<p>You will be amused with one of my discoveries.
I was offered an egg, with the recommendation, that
it was “a country laid egg.” I had thought myself,
until that moment, deeply versed in the mystery
of cooking and eating eggs, whether <i lang="fr">à la
coq</i>, or, in <i lang="fr">omelettes</i>. Never before, had I heard,
that an egg laid in the country, was better than one
laid in a town! I was once told, (it was when a boy,)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
that the fashion in cooking eggs, like every thing
else, was running from one extreme to the other,
provincial ignorance having been suddenly enlightened,
and from boiling them as hard as bullets, we
had exaggerated the new mode by barely warming
them through. An egg should be cooked, <i lang="fr">à la coq</i>,
just enough to allow the centre of the yolk to run
while warm, and to become hard when cold. It
should always be eaten from the shell, both because
it is better taken in that way, and because it is not
gentlemanly to be making messes, and more especially
unsightly messes, at tables The wine glass
or egg-glass, is an abomination, and altogether a
most vulgar substitute for the egg-cup, and one
quite unfit to be seen any where but in a steamboat,
or a tavern frequented by <em>gulpers</em>. All men
accustomed to polite life will agree to this, but how
many know the difference between a “town-laid”
and “a country-laid egg?” You see by these little
incidents how far a new country may be from an
advanced state of civilization, notwithstanding it
possesses gallowses.</p>

<p>The conversation at Mr. L——’s, whom I
had known in America, turned on the begging
mission of Bishop Chase of Ohio. One of the
gentlemen gave an account of this prelate’s church
statistics that startled me a little. The population
of the state was set down at pretty near a million,
and the clergy at less than a dozen! I ventured to
say that this must be a mistake, unless clergymen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
of the Protestant Episcopal Church were exclusively
meant. There is always a period in the
first settlement of a region where there is a deficiency
in the spiritual ministrations, but the accounts
should not go forth unaccompanied by the
explanations, for they tend to mislead. The statements
relative to drunkenness, got up for effect by
the Temperance Societies at home, are giving us
an undeserved reputation for that vice, of which I
feel convinced we have, relatively, <em>among the native
population</em>, as little as any other nation I
have visited, and much less than most of them. I
feel persuaded there is a party in America that
wishes to see <ins class="corr" id="tn-111" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'these mistatements'">
these misstatements</ins> propagated, in
order to bring free institutions into disrepute, a party
that embraces a large portion of the trading foreigners,
and verily they achieve their object, for
democracy and drunkenness are closely associated
in the minds of millions of the well-intentioned in
this hemisphere. If free principles do prevail, it
will be under the providence of God, and through
their own energies; for those who spout loudest in
their praise at home, and even carry out their doctrines
to untenable extremes, take the least heed
of any thing that does not immediately affect their
own personal interests, and as for the government
it actually throws its weight into the hostile scale
on this side of the Atlantic, opposing its own friends
and rewarding its enemies. This is a singular state
of things, but such is the result not only of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
own observations, but of those of various intelligent
countrymen of ours, who have seen much more of
Europe than myself. Were I an office seeker, I
would at once resort to the meannesses that obtain
for an American the outward favours of the aristocracies
of Europe, whatever may be their secret
opinions, as the most certain method of being deemed
worthy of the confidence of the government at
Washington, and of obtaining a reputation in the
circles at home.</p>

<p>I have lately had an extraordinary proof of what
I now tell you. At one of the dinner’s at Lansdowne-house,
Mr. Brougham was present. He came
late, and took his seat at the table opposite to the
end at which I sat. Of course we had no conversation
during dinner. As we were retiring to the
drawing-room, Lord Lansdowne did me the favour
to present me to this distinguished man. The introduction
took place at the dining-room door, and we
walked across an ante-chamber together, when the
usual compliments and civilities passed. We had
no sooner reached the ladies and made our bows,
than Mr. Brougham turned to me, and abruptly
demanded—“What is the reason so many of your
people desert the distinctive principles of your
government, when they come to Europe?”</p>

<p>I have been thus particular in relating the circumstances
under which this extraordinary question
was put, for I think they prove what was uppermost
in the mind of Mr. Brougham, and the strong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
impression that had been left by the circumstance
to which he alluded. It is quite evident that this
impression must have been unfavourable either to
the institutions, or to the candour of the national
character.</p>

<p>I hoped the fact was not so. “My experience
would say it is,” was the answer. “To what class
of men do you allude, in particular, Mr. Brougham?”
“To your foreign ministers, especially,” he said. I
thought this very extraordinary, and said as much,
and, as something might depend on the character of
the individual, I begged him to name one of those
who left this impression behind him. He did,
mentioning, without reserve, a distinguished minister
of the republic, who is now dead. To all this,
I could only say, that I supposed a mistaken desire
to make themselves agreeable must have been at the
bottom of such a course; and here the conversation
dropped, by mutual consent.</p>

<p>I do not know whether this conversation will
strike you as it struck me, for I confess it would
seem that we have some “country laid” ministers,
or our ministers have felt confident of having had
very “country laid” constituents.</p>

<p>Mr. Brougham was desirous of knowing how
we contrive to print books so cheaply, as he had
understood we did, labour being so dear. He had
been told that Scott’s novels were sold for a dollar a
copy. The secret of this fact, is to be found in the
meanness of execution, the extent and the rapidity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
of the demand, and most of all, in the circumstance,
that the author is paid nothing. A reprint,
moreover, is not made from a manuscript, and has
no alterations, and few corrections. In addition to
all this, the press correction of books, is immeasurably
more accurate and laboured in England, than
in America. Men of education are employed here,
as proof readers, and, perhaps, most of the popular
authors of England, have very little knowledge of
the grammar of their own language. All these people
must be paid, and the money is charged against
the work.</p>

<p>A novel, of no great merit, will bring its author
four or five hundred pounds in England, especially
if it be at all supposed to bring the reader in contact
with the feelings and sentiments of the “nobility
and gentry.” So profound is the deference of those
who live in shadow, for those who are beneath the
sun’s rays, in this country, that the price of a lord’s
pen, is considerably higher, than that of a commoner’s!
I dare say, it will be a new idea to you,
to measure literary merit by a pedigree, but it is a
mode much practised here. A lady of condition,
lately offered a novel to a fashionable publisher, and
the answer was, “two hundred if anonymous, and
five hundred with the name of the author;” the
latter, you will understand, having no other value
than that of rank, the book being a first effort. An
application was made to me, to contribute to an
annual, and, by way of inducement, I was shown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
a list of those who had engaged to write for it,
among whom, were six or eight lords. Curious to
know, how far these people submitted to vulgar
considerations, I put the question, and was given
to understand, that they were not only paid as
writers, but paid as lords. The moon may not be
made of green cheese, but rely on it, could we get
near enough to discover its substance, it would turn
out essentially different from any thing we imagine.</p>

<p>There was a boy, the heir of a very high title, at
one of my late breakfasts. He went away the first,
to go to school, I fancy, and the master of the house
made the mistake of leaving us, while he went to
the ante-chamber, to see the lad off. When he returned,
he came up to me, with a momentous manner,
and muttered, “three earldom’s in the family!”
I was compelled to compare this, with the total absence
of fuss about boys and girls of rank on the
continent of Europe. Just before we left Paris, at
a child’s ball, a little girl, who was selected to dance
with one of the princes, was told by her mother, to
say, “monseigneur,” in speaking to her partner.
After they had got a little warmed with the exercise,
the pretty little thing turned round to the boy
and said—“why am I to call you ‘<i lang="fr">monseigneur</i>,’
are you a bishop?” “<i lang="fr">Je n’en sais rien, moi</i>,”
was the answer. There is young ——, he is the heir
of vast estates, of palaces without number, and of a
collection of pictures and statuary alone, that would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
constitute a large fortune. There are five or six
principalities in the family, and when he is married,
he is to take one of these titles, until he succeeds
to the ancient and historical distinctive appellation
of his race. But, at present, no one calls
him by any thing but his Christian name, although
nearly a man!</p>

<p>It appears to me, that the nobles of this country,
themselves, make very little parade of their claims,
but that the fuss comes principally from those who
deem it an honour to be their associates. Nothing
more deranges the philosophy of one of the true devotees
of rank here, than to find that others do not
worship the idol with the same zeal as himself.</p>

<span class="fs70">TO RICHARD COOPER, ESQUIRE, COOPERSTOWN.</span></h2>


<p>Perhaps, I ought not to confess the weakness,
but we have actually been to see the tower. Luckily,
the “lions” have been sold, so we escaped the
most vulgar part of the exhibition.</p>

<p>The tower proper, is a square building, with
four turrets, or rather towers at the angles, and
is by no means large, though it is said to be as ancient
as the conquest. The Romans are thought to
have had a fortress, at, or near, its site. In addition
to this building, however, there is a little dingy
town around it, principally built of bricks, and
surrounded by a ditch and walls. The latter
have regular bastions, and the former is wide, deep,
and wet, feeling the influence of the tides of the
river, for the whole stand immediately on its
banks.</p>

<p>This place has been so often described, that I
shall say little beyond our general impressions. It
struck us as much less imposing than Vincennes,
though venerable by time and associations. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
tower itself will not compare with the <span lang="fr">donjon</span> of
Vincennes, its French counterpart, and the adjuncts,
are equally below those of the Tower of
Paris.</p>

<p>The collection of armour disappointed us greatly,
being altogether less interesting, than the fine specimens
of the <i lang="fr">musée de l’artillerie</i>, near the church
of St. Thomas d’Aquin; a museum of whose existence
nine Frenchmen in ten seem to be profoundly
ignorant, while it is one of the most curious
things in Europe. Unfortunately, some musty antiquarian
has lately robbed the armour of the tower,
of all claims to be considered genuine, or as appertaining
to the persons of the great men, on whose
effigies it is displayed, and therein he has annihilated
most of its interest. “Where ignorance is
bliss, ’tis folly to be wise.” I wish, with all my
heart, the man had not been half so learned, for,
like a novel by Scott, or a play by Shakspeare, in
this case the fiction was probably more interesting,
than the reality. We ought not to quarrel with
truth, however, since there is little danger of our
getting too much of it.</p>

<p>Of course, we looked at the regalia, but with
little interest, for it is not handsome, and I suspect
most of the stones are false. The precaution is
used, of showing it by the light of a lamp. A
crown, notwithstanding, is a famous sight for the
English multitude. I would rather take, at random,
one of the cases of precious articles, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
Louvre, or at the <i lang="fr">Jardins des Plantes</i>, than the
imperial crown of Great Britain. What between
the Stuarts, and some of the later princes, your
<i lang="la">bonâ fide</i> jewels must have been made of steel to
withstand their rapacity. Depend on it, had the
crown been worth any thing, James II. would have
looked to it, although he ran away from his kingdom.</p>

<p>There are some curious old implements of war,
here; but, by no means as many, or as rare, as in
the collection at Paris. They showed us the axe
with which Anna Boleyn was beheaded, and, sure
enough, it was a weapon to make quick work of a
“little neck.” I was most struck with a sword or
two, that I could not hold at arm’s length, and
which would really seem to demonstrate, that as
our minds expand, our bodies shrink. Will the day
ever come when matter shall disappear altogether,
to give place to the <ins class="corr" id="tn-119" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'etherial essence'">
ethereal essence</ins> of the spirit?
The sight of these swords, and of that of some of
the armour, is the first position proved, in demonstrating
the existence of giants, and where are they
to-day?</p>

<p>I went to dine with —— ——, on our return.
This gentleman had been civil enough to send me
two or three invitations, and I now went a little
out of my way to manifest a sense of his persevering
politeness. I was the first there; but a
large party came pouring in immediately after,
not a soul of whom had I ever seen before.
The old Earl of ——, the Earl of ——, the son of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
the chief of the Irish volunteers, and his wife,
Lord ——, Sir —— ——, and many others
were announced, in quick succession. Finding it
awkward to stand in a crowd with no one to speak
to, I looked at the pictures, of which the house was
full. While engaged in this way, a young man
came up and spoke to me. It was civil in him, for
it appeared to me that he saw I was a stranger; the
only stranger in the party, and wished to be polite
accordingly. We conversed a few minutes, at a
window, that was a little removed from the rest of
the company.</p>

<p>They have become punctual at London, and I do
not think it was fifteen minutes from the time I
entered, before dinner was announced. Each of
the men took a lady, for there happened to be
pretty nearly a tie, and disappeared, leaving my
companion and myself standing where we were, by
the window. He seemed uneasy, and I thought the
movement, a rare specimen of extreme delicacy of
deportment. The only stranger, and he old enough
to be the father of some of the young men who had
dashed ahead of him, was left standing in the drawing-room,
as if he were a part of the furniture! I
looked hard at my companion, to see if he had the
family physiognomy, but he had not, and then I
ventured to observe, “that if we were to dine with
the rest of them, it might not be amiss to follow.”</p>

<p>As we are endeavouring to trace national manners,
I will relate an anecdote that occurred just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
before I left Paris. Madame de —— invited
G—— to a great dinner, where he was the only
stranger, with the exception of an unexpected guest.
That person happened to be Count Capo d’Istrias,
the president elect of Greece. Just before dinner
was announced, G—— removed to a little distance
from the lady of the house, for his invitation had
been so worded as to give him reason to think that
the entertainment was a compliment to himself, and
he could not for an instant dream of preferring claims
in competition with M. Capo d’Istrias. Madame
de —— took the arm of the president elect, and
walking towards him, she did him the favour to
present him to Mad. de Talleyrand, who was of the
party, and whom he had the honour of leading to
the dinner table. These are trifles, but they are just
the trifles that mark the difference between the social
tact of London, and that of Paris.</p>

<p>I could not divest myself of the idea, that had I
been any thing but an American, this cutting neglect
would not have occurred; and when I found that
precisely the lowest seat at the table was left for
me, I endeavoured to <ins class="corr" id="tn-121" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'recal that passage'">
recall that passage</ins> in Holy
Writ, where one is directed to take the lowest place
at a feast, as a course good for the soul. Although
we have no established religion in America, I will
be bold enough to say, that no one else, that day,
bethought him of this text.</p>

<p>My companion, after all, proved to be a connexion
of the family, for the seat, at the foot of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
table, had been left for him. The master of the
house sat at the other end, and the mistress in the
centre, according to the French mode; so you will
perceive I was literally <i lang="la">in extremis</i>, at this banquet.
So much care having been taken of myself, I
felt curious to see in what manner the others had been
provided for. A swarthy, dark-haired common-looking
young man sat on the right of the mistress of
the house, while old Lord ——, who was a full
general in the army, occupied a more humble situation.
This young man was also a soldier, for I
heard him talking of a campaign he had made, but,
by his years, he could not have been more than a
colonel, at most, if as high in the army. Of course
he must have been of a political or social rank higher
than either of the two earls, and this, in England,
would give him precedence of his own father! I
believe he was the Duke of ——.</p>

<p>A handsome, well-mannered young man sat on
my left. Indeed, our end of the table was pretty
much occupied by the boys, and I began to apprehend
a roasting on account of a few gray hairs that
time is scattering around my temples. They were
well-behaved lads, however; I suppose, on account
of their being in parliament, as I found, by the conversation,
was the case with the whole of them.
They had all been rowing on the Thames, that
morning, and as I had urged the oar myself, in my
time, we had at least something to talk about.</p>

<p>The black-haired dignitary gave an account of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
the death of some officer, whom he had seen shot in
battle. He had himself found the body, after the
affair; and, he added, “it had been stripped by the
French soldiers.”—“Why not by our own?” put
in my young neighbour, rather pithily. “Because
I do not think any of ours had been near it,” was
the answer; but it sounded like an <i lang="fr">arrière pensée</i>.</p>

<p>It appeared well on the part of my neighbour, to
suggest the doubt, and I fell into discourse with
him. He had discovered that I was an American,
by a remark of my right-hand companion, who
knew the fact, and he soon began to speak of the
difference in language between the English and
Americans. He told me he had just come from
Paris, and that, while strolling in the Palais Royal,
he had been struck with the pronunciation of three
men, who were walking before him. Their dialect
was provincial, and he had been at a loss to discover
from what part of England they had come, when
he ascertained, by their discourse, they were Americans.
I told him we had social <em>castes</em> in America,
as in England, though they were less strongly
marked than common; and that men, of course,
betrayed their associations in nothing sooner than
in their modes of speech. He admitted the justice
of this distinction; but I question if he had ever
before thought of America, except as a jumble of a
whole people in one <i lang="la">omnium gatherum</i>. He
made a remark that I felt to be just, and one could
wish it might be made in the ears of all those who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
concoct the president’s and governors’ messages, of
the critics, and of the writers of the whole nation. He
said he was struck with the manner in which we
used the word “our.” We did not say “America,”
but “<em>our</em> country,” “<em>our</em> people,” “<em>our</em> laws,”
“<em>our</em> this,” “<em>our</em> that,” “<em>our</em> t’other.” I had
been disagreeably impressed, myself, with the same
peculiarity, for it is clearly bad, since “<em>the</em> country,”
“<em>the</em> laws,” “<em>the</em> institutions,” could mean
no other than those of the country <ins class="corr" id="tn-124" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'in dicussion, and'">
in discussion, and</ins> would be in better taste. I did not admit this,
however, for I had been put at the foot of the
table, on account of that country, and one never receives
scurvy treatment even for a defect or a
misfortune that cannot be helped, that he does not
begin to defend it. I told my young critic that it
was all for want of a name, the term “United
States” being too long, and that the institutions
favoured the notion of a right of property in every
thing national. He acquiesced in the reasons,
which no doubt are the true ones, but he did not
appear the more to admire the taste; an opinion
that, between ourselves, he entertains in common
with some others.</p>

<p>This young man amused me with the entire coolness
with which he complimented me on my English
being as good as usual. These people are so
accustomed to think of us as inferiors, that the bad
taste of telling a man in society, “really, now, I
do not see but you know how to speak, or to use<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
a fork, or to drink your wine, or to go through the
manual of polite life, quite as well as one of us,”
never appears to strike them. One gets a good
many of these oblique compliments, here. My
young neighbour was modest, and sensible, but
he made this obvious blunder.</p>

<p>My brother statue began to speak of America,
and his right-hand neighbours listened a little too
superciliously for men who had so unceremoniously
exalted themselves, and I longed for an opportunity
to let them understand whereabouts America lay,
and the sort of stuff of which she was made. Chance
favoured me, for my neighbour happened to express
his apprehensions that the difficulties of Europe
might bring about a war, to which America
would become a party. “I trembled” he said,
“the other day, when the Navarino affair took
place, for a war would compel us to impress; and
then America <em>might</em> think fit to resent it.” I
told him that impressment, continued a week, out
of American vessels, would undeniably produce
a war. “Why cannot the two governments amicably
settle the matter, by admitting a mutual, search
in each other’s ships?” “Such a privilege would
be nominal as respects us, as we could not profit by
it; the institutions would forbid impressment.”
“It is a thousand pities the question cannot be settled.”
“We hold it to be settled, already, by the
law of nations and common sense. The right to
impress is not an international but a municipal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
right, and, of course, can be exercised legally only
within the jurisdiction of the nation using it. England
has no more claim to follow her seamen into
our territory, than to follow her criminals. If we
were to send constables to London to arrest thieves,
or on board ships on the high seas, we should soon
hear of it. Jurisdictions cannot conflict, in this
manner, or there is an end of the immunities of
national character.” “What is then to be done?”
“You ask us to concede a favour, and a high favour,
that of subjecting the citizen to impositions and
trouble for your sole benefit. Now, I think a scheme
can be suggested by which the matter may be disposed
of.” By this time, every ear was pricked up,
and attentive, I proceeded—“As for permitting
English officers to be the judges of the matter, it is
out of the question. We never can concede, and
never ought to concede that point. But give us a
<i lang="la">quid pro quo</i> and we may be induced to pass laws
that shall purge our shipping, as near as may be, of
your seamen.” “What could we offer?” “There
is the island of Bermuda; you hold it, solely, as a
hostile port to be used against us; I think for the
peaceable possession of that island, our government
would make some sacrifice, and”—here I paused a
moment, between a reluctance to hurt my brother
statue’s <i lang="fr">amour propre</i>, and the recollection of my
own attitude on the pedestal, the latter prevailing—“and,
by way of inducement to make the arrangement
you ought to remember that twenty years
hence, England will not be able to hold it.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>The dose worked particularly well. Head went
to head, until the idea passed up the table, quite beyond
the salt. I heard Lord E—— exclaim “it is
too bad!” I did not think it half as bad, however,
as putting a foot on the neck of a stranger, and,
moreover, it was true.</p>

<p>The effect of the hint, was quickly apparent, for
we were no sooner in the drawing-room than I was
approached by half a dozen lords, and I dare say if
the dinner were to be gone over again, the bearings
and distance from the salt would have been materially
altered. I shook the dust off my feet, in quitting
that house.</p>

<p>I believe I have not told you an adventure at
another house. This was at a dinner given by a
merchant; a man of the city, but who does not
live in the city, for the <em>cits</em> are now fairly rooted
in the west end. When dinner was announced
the master of the house formally bowed to me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
and mentioned my name. This is an invitation,
all over the world, to take the <i lang="fr">pas</i>. I advanced
accordingly, and offered my arm to the lady; but
she very cooly refused it, presenting me to a Mrs.
Somebody who sat by her, and took the arm<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
of some one else. As this person certainly had no
title, and was an Englishman, and much younger
than myself, I was at a loss to discover his claims.
It would have been better had the good man and
his wife understood each other, previously, for the
effect was to make me appear <i lang="fr">tant soit peu</i> ridiculous.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="LETTER_XXII">LETTER XXII.<br>
<span class="fs70">TO JACOB SUTHERLAND, ESQUIRE.</span></h2>


<p>I have had a singular conversation with a foreigner.
This person is a cosmopolite, a —— by
birth, who has lived much in England and
America, and our discourse had reference to the
opinions and expectations that prevail here concerning
our own national character and national destiny.
As my companion had no doubts as to the manner
in which his communication would be received, he
spoke without reserve.</p>

<p>He commenced by saying that a very general
impression existed in England that the man of
America was not equally gifted, in mind, with the
man of Europe. This is merely the old opinion
continued to our own times, and I was fully aware
of its existence. Captain Hall, when he says that
there is <em>no want of natural ability</em> in the American
people, but that their deficiencies proceed from
defective educations, is merely addressing his remark
to this prejudice. Almost every English
traveller, who has written of the republic, betrays<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
the existence of the same notion, in some way or
other. But it is so easy for an American, who is
not completely blinded by national vanity, to ascertain
these truths, by concealing his origin, while
travelling in the stage-coaches, that, to me, it is
matter of surprise any one who has visited England
should be ignorant of them.</p>

<p>Almost every American, whose name reaches
this country, in consequence of its being connected
with any thing that is thought creditable, is incontinently
claimed as an expatriated European. You
can have no notion of the extent to which this prejudice
is carried. I do assure you, that I have myself
heard a respectable man, here, affirm that, in
one of the counties of England, he had been a
school-fellow of Washington, before the latter emigrated!
Mr. Irving figures in biographical notices
here, as a native of Devonshire, and even my own
humble claims have not been overlooked, as by a
sketch of a pretended life, which now lies on my
table, my origin is traced to the Isle of Man, and
in an elaborated sort of Blue Book, which contains
a list of English writers, I find myself enrolled
among men, who have far more reason to be ashamed
of me, than I have to be ashamed of them. I
have been asked quite lately, if Macdonough were
not an Irishman, and I believe, my affirmation that
poor Allen, who was killed in the Argus, was an
American, was absolutely discredited. I met with
an assertion, some time since, in one of the journals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
here, that “Commodore Rodgers was a Scotch
baker, of the name of Gray!” The periodical
publications of the day, are filled with spurious
histories of most of our distinguished men, during
the revolution, replete with the usual scurrility and
untruths; and even the last war, brought with it,
the same touches of amiable veracity.</p>

<p>The national prejudices of England, are freely
commented on, by all other people. Prejudice,
however, belongs to man, rather than to communities,
and I am inclined to think France has almost
as many as this country, though they are of a different
quality, and are infinitely better cloaked. In
making this comparison, I always except the subject
of America, for that is a point on which an
Englishman usually ceases altogether, to be either
just, or discerning.</p>

<p>One of the traits which the English attribute to
us, is a greater disposition than common to lie. I
have no hesitation in saying, that this nation deems
our own, addicted to this vice, altogether out of
the ordinary way. On this point, there can be
no mistake, for Captain Hall, Mr. De Roos, and
several other recent writers, even by exonerating
us from the charge, betray its existence; but we
have high clerical authority for it, that will settle the
matter. I quote Bishop Heber; he is speaking of
the American sailors. “They are not so grievously
addicted to lying, as they were once said to be.
<em>They have less animosity against the English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
than formerly, and their character seems to have
recovered its natural English tone.</em>” Dr. Heber
might have been puzzled to explain, in what the
<em>natural</em> English character differs from any other, on
principles that would harmonize with the thirty-nine
articles, of which, I believe, we possess a tolerably
accurate copy, in our own church. But, putting
orthodoxy out of the question, and not descending
to a too rigid construction of words, how was this
notion of the American people, and especially of
their seamen, obtained? I think, I can explain it.</p>

<p>The English were accustomed to consider themselves
the most skilful mariners of the earth.
When their American competitors boasted of their
own ships, that they could outsail those of England,
and that their general qualities were better, verifying
all by alleged facts, the latter, as a matter of
course, were deemed lies. Were a hundred English
ship-masters to assert to-day, that their vessels
could outsail ours, the American seamen would
have no more charity, but, at once, set them down
as dealers in fiction. During the long wars, our
shipping was the prey of the belligerents, the English,
as the most numerous, doing it the most
harm; vexing commerce, by impressing the seamen,
and as often carrying off the native, as their
own subjects. These acts created a bitter feeling,
and the American government, influenced by a
miserable penny-saving policy, which cost more in
the end, than a prompt resistance, almost abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
the seamen to themselves; writing long diplomatic
notes, instead of arming. I know, by personal observation,
that many of our ship-masters of that
day, boasted they had mislead English squadrons
and cruizers, by false information, for it was the
only means they had, of avenging themselves.</p>

<p>Conversing with Mr. ——, he informed me that,
for some time, an acquaintance of ours, a captain
in the British navy, was supposed to have been
killed in the attack on Fort Bowyer. On my asking
how the information had been obtained, he
quite unconsciously answered—“Oh! it was only
the report of an American captain.” I laughed
at him, for this confession, and he frankly admitted
an opinion prevailed in England, that the
American ship-masters were greater liars than
usual.</p>

<p>Our facts are astounding, and, when related, appear
marvellous to foreigners. <i lang="fr">Au reste</i>, the Americans,
more particularly those of New England,
are a gossipping people, and though the gossip may
not be a liar, he necessarily circulates much untruth.
In this manner, the American lies with his tongue,
while the rest of the world lie only in their thoughts.
But lying is one of the commonest vices of humanity.</p>

<p>It is fortunate that Providence has reserved us
for the justice of another state of being, for, it is
certain, there is very little in this. Here is a nation,
that, if a civil agent of its own, arrest John<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
Doe, for Richard Roe, punishes him severely,
throwing the <em>onus</em> of the proof of guilt, on the
minister of the law, but which goes out of its own
jurisdiction, to demand of foreigners proofs of innocence;
failing of which, it lays violent hands on
them, exposes them to mutilation and death, in a
quarrel in which they have no concern, and then
vilifies them, by way of atonement! This is bad
enough, certainly, but it is, by no means, the worst
feature in the affair. Men, in the condition of gentlemen,
have been found among the oppressed, to
justify the wrong, for you and I are both old
enough, distinctly to remember the time, when
England was loudly and openly vindicated by a
party, at home, in a course that set all national honour,
and national justice at defiance. It is said, that
the world presents nothing new; that all its current
incidents are merely new phases of old events;
but, really, it sometimes seems to me, that the history
of man has never before presented so strong an
instance of national abasement, as is to be found in
the feelings, language, reasoning, and acts of a
very large portion of what are called the better
classes of the American people, towards Great Britain.
Of all burthens, that of the mental dependance
created by colonial subserviency, appears to
be the most difficult to remove. It weighs upon us
yet, like an incubus, and, apart from matters of
gain, in which we have all our eyes about us, and
apart from party politics, in which men will “follow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
their leaders, though it be to the devil,” there is
not an American, in my opinion, at this moment,
of sufficient note fairly to attract foreign comment,
who does not hold his reputation at home, entirely
at the mercy of Great Britain. We do not see this
fact ourselves, but strangers do, and deride us for
the weakness. We have, indeed, reason to thank
God, that the portion of the nation, which constitutes
its bone and muscle, although of no account
in its floating opinions, is so purely practical, so
stubborn in its nationality, so right-thinking, at
least, in the matters that come properly and fairly
before it, and so little likely to be influenced to its
destruction!</p>

<p>Another of the notions that exists in England,
is that of the hostility of America to Great Britain.
All the recent travellers among us, frankly admit
that they see no evidence of such a feeling, but of
one quite to the contrary. I have frequently told
my friends here, that, in my opinion, and it is an
opinion formed from a good deal of observation,
<em>in no other country are the English looked
upon with as friendly eyes, as in the United
States of America</em>. I feel as certain of this fact,
as I do of any other moral truth at which I believe
myself to have arrived by investigation and travelling.
I do not think that I have succeeded, however,
in convincing a single individual.</p>

<p>A few of the public writers here, affect to maintain
that there is no general inimical sentiment, or
prejudice in England, against the United States,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
with the Edinburgh Review at their head. It
might as well be denied that the sun appears in the
east, and sets in the west. The feeling is as apparent
as the day; it mingles with every thought,
colours every concession, and even tempers the
charities. Every American established in the country
asserts it, all travellers believe it, even Captain
Hall and other writers confess it, and four out of
five, on the spot, when circumstances induce frankness,
admit it. Let us look for the reasons of these
contradictory feelings, in the two nations.</p>

<p>In the collisions between the two people, in the
main, America has won and England has lost. The
winner is usually complacent, the loser soured. In
America facts have preceded opinion, and so far
from their being a tendency to aid the first by appeals
to prejudices, the disposition has been to retard
them by comparisons favourable to the old system.
The very opposite of this state of things exists
in England. Power, in America, has nothing to
apprehend from English example, while power, in
England, has much to apprehend from the example
of America. This reason applies with peculiar
force to the church in England, which ought to be
the first to foster the charities. It is natural for a
young people to look back with affection to their
ancestry, and to the country from which they sprung,
and it is human for those in possession of advantages
that once were exclusive, to look forward with
distrust to the fortunes of a vigorous competitor that
has arisen from their own stock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>These reasons might suffice, but there are others,
which, though less evident, have perhaps been more
active in producing the unfriendly feeling in England.
In this country, it should always be remembered,
there is a contradiction between the theory
of the government and its facts. By the first the
sovereign possesses an authority, that is denied him
in practice. No well-informed man really thinks
that the King of England, of his own free will, could
declare war, for instance, and yet the commentators
will tell you he may. In curbing his authority,
the aristocracy is compelled to keep in view the
nation, and the principal means that have been resorted
to for influencing it, have been to act on its
prejudices. Nothing has struck me more forcibly,
here, than the manner in which the higher classes
keep themselves free from the national prejudices,
that their organs, the press, studiously excite in the
mass. This is said without any reference to America,
however, for the aristocracy certainly likes <em>us</em>
as little as any portion of the community, and without
alluding to the mere difference that always
exists between knowledge and ignorance, but to
notions, which if true, ought to be found more
general among the instructed, than among the ignorant.</p>

<p>I perceive that Capt. Hall lays much stress on
the loyalty of the English, as a healthful sentiment
that is quite unknown in America. He has not
attached too much importance to this feeling, in my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
judgment, though he has scarcely analysed it with
sufficient penetration. This loyalty is a pure abstraction
in England, on which, by dint of management,
the self love of the nation has been concentrated.
It is national pride, interest, and national
prejudice, to all of which this direction has been
given, so far as they are connected with sentiment,
for to say that the usual personal attachment has
any thing to do with it, in regard to a monarch
whom his people have quietly seen stripped,
<ins class="corr" id="tn-138" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'one by by one'">
one by one</ins>, of the free exercise of all his prerogatives
involves an absurdity. No one is more loyal in
England, than the Duke who is acquiring boroughs,
with a view to return members whose principal
duty will be to vote down and curb the royal
authority. Such a man, it is true, declaims against
disloyalty as a crime; he defends the prerogative
both in person and by his nominees; but then he
takes good care that it shall be exercised by a minister,
whom he has an agency in creating, and with
whom he can make his own terms. It would not
do to transfer this sentiment from him who has not,
to those who actually wield the power of the state,
and who are compelled to live so much before the
common eye, for there are too many of them; they
are unsupported by the prejudice of birth, and
familiarity would soon destroy the portion of the
feeling that is the most useful.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The force of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
fiction, loyalty (it is purely fiction, as it relates to
the individual), is inconceivably strong; for I question
if the English, after their own fashion, are not
the most loyal people in Europe. Their feelings,
in this particular, give one good reason to doubt
whether men will not defer more to an abstraction,
than to a reality.</p>

<p>Another of the prejudices of the English arises<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
from the devotedness of the faith with which they
subscribe to the fictions of their own system. In no
other country is society so socially drilled. Lord
—— observed to me, “England is a pyramid, in
which every man has his place, and of which the
king forms the point.” The remark has some truth
in it, but the peer overlooked the essential fact,
that where the summit ought to be the base
of his pyramid is. This social drilling, however,
like almost every thing else, has its advantages
and its disadvantages. The better soldier
you make of a man the more he becomes
disqualified to be any thing else. You have no
notion of the extent to which the ethics of station
are carried, in this country; being probably
quite as much beyond the point of reason and manliness,
in one extreme, as the canting of the press,
and the brawls of low party politicians are driving
it to the other, with us. I have seen a footman’s
manual, in which, besides the explanations of active
duties, the whole <i lang="fr">morale</i> of his station, is set
before the student, with great precision and solemnity.
It is a sort of social catechism. So effectually
has the system of drill been pursued, that I
firmly believe, a majority of Englishmen, at this
moment, attach an idea of immorality, to any
serious effort to alter the phases of society. It is
deemed social treason, and like other treason, the
notion of crime is connected with it. The benefits of
this drilling, are great order, with perfect seemliness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
and method, in conducting the affairs of life; the
defects, the substitution of artificial for the natural
links of society, form for feeling, and the inward
festering of the mind, which, sooner or later, will
be certain to break out on the surface, and disfigure,
if it do not destroy, the body politic. There is no
comparison between the <em>finish</em> of an English, and that
of a French servant, for instance, as regards the thousand
little details of duty. One is as much superior
to the other, as an English is superior to a French
knife. But, when it comes to feeling, the advantage
is all the other way. The English servant will
not bear familiarity, scarcely kindness: the Frenchman
will hardly dispense with both. To the first
you never speak, unless to order; the latter is treated
as an humble friend. The revolution in France,
has shown instances of devotedness and affection, in
consequence, that no revolution in England will
ever be likely to see equalled.</p>

<p>One of the effects of the prejudices of the country,
is to supercede facts and reasoning, by a set of dogmatical
inferences, which the Englishman receives
quite as a matter of course, and as beyond discussion.
I could give you a hundred examples of what I mean,
but a recent instance shall suffice.</p>

<p>In a discussion with the conductor of a periodical
work, who is friendly to America, I have had occasion
to note the following errors in relation to
ourselves. Speaking of the expedition of Captain
Parry to the north, he bestows very merited encomiums<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
on the conduct of the crews, which he attributes
to their good training, as Englishmen. By
way of illustrating the difference between such a
system, and one that may, with great justice, pass
for its converse, he gave an account of an exploring
expedition sent out by the government of the
United States, to the Pacific Ocean, in which the
men had put their officers on shore, and had gone a
sealing! You are to understand, that my acquaintance
had been pressing me to contribute to his work,
with the object of correcting the erroneous notions,
which prevail in England, in regard to America.</p>

<p>“Here, said I, is an instance of the sweeping deductions
that you form. You imagine a fact, and directly
in the teeth of testimony, go to work to produce
your inferences. The United States never sent an
expedition of the sort any where, and, of course,
no such occurrence could have taken place. Now,
as to the principle, I may speak from some personal
knowledge, and I tell you that, according to my
experience, the English seamen are much the most
turbulent, and the Americans much the most tractable,
and the least likely to violate law, of any with
whom I have ever had any thing to do. In point
of fact, the officers of no American cruizer, ever
lost the command of their vessel, for an hour, or,
perhaps I might say, a minute, though two or three
slight instances of insubordination did occur, under
the old laws, and when the terms of service of the
men were legally up; but, owing to the spirit of
the officers, and the habits of subordination in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
crews, in every one of even these instances, the
resistance was immediately quelled. What is the
other side of the picture? Did not the crews of
several English vessels, murder their officers, and
run away with the ships, during the last war?
There are the cases of the Hermione, and the
Bounty, for instance, and this assertion of yours is
made in face of the notorious historical fact, that,
within the memory of man, the British empire was
made to tremble to its centre, by the mutiny of
the Nore!”</p>

<p>I believe my acquaintance was struck with this
representation, and I expected to see an explanation
in his work, but the next number contained a
paragraph, which deprecated the admission of matter
that conflicted with the <em>national prejudices</em>!</p>

<p>So far as mere manner is concerned, the English
drilling produces better results, in every day life,
than our own <i lang="fr">pêle mêle</i>. A good portion of the
<i lang="fr">grossieretè</i>, at home, is for the want of the condensed
class of well-bred people, of which I have so often
spoken, and the moral cowardice of men, who have
too often ardent longings for the glitter of life,
without the manliness to enforce its decencies.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Could the two nations meet half way, in this respect,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
both would be essentially gainers, we in
appearances, and in the decencies connected with
manner, and the English in the more kindly feelings,
and in security. There is undeniably, a cant
obtaining the ascendancy at home, that is destructive
of all manner, in conducting the ordinary relations
of life, and which is not free from danger, as
it confounds the substance of things with their
shadow. Democracy has no necessary connexion
with vulgarity, but it merely means that men shall
have equal political rights. There can be no greater
fallacy than to say, one man is as good as another,
in all things. In the eye of God, men are equal,
and happy is the country, in which it is not dangerous
to declare, also, that they shall be perfectly
equal in all their legal privileges. But beyond this,
the principle cannot be carried, and civilization
maintained. One man has higher tastes, more learning,
better principles, more strength, more beauty,
and greater natural abilities, than another. I take
it, that human institutions, are intended to prevent
him, who is the most powerful; in consequence of
the possession of these advantages, from injuring
him who is weaker. The relations between master
and servant, are not all affected thereby, and he
who submits to labour for hire, under the directions
of an employer serves, while the other commands.
These duties may be conducted with too little, as
well as too much deference of manner. The tendency
in civilized society, is always toward the
latter, when the usual proportions between surface<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
and population are obtained, for it is a consequence
of the pressure of society, and there is little
fear that we shall not get our share of it, in time;
though, <i lang="fr">en attendant</i>, we find occasional instances,
in which the individual mistakes insolence, for independence.
Perhaps, after all, <em>insolence</em> is too
strong a word. I think, I have met more pure insolence
from Englishmen in low situations, than
from Americans; it is the natural consequence of
reaction; though it is rare, indeed, to meet with
the same deference from the last, as from the first.
Assemble, in any reasonable space in America, a
dozen genteel families, and they will, of their own
influence, create an atmosphere of decency, about
them, that shall contain all that is really desirable,
in this respect. The inherent sense of right,
which is implanted in every man by nature, and
which becomes conscience in moral things, may
be safely confided in, as the surest means of regulating
the deportment of the different castes of
society, towards each other.</p>

<p>There is a very general notion prevalent in England,
that we seized a moment to declare war
against them, when they were pressed upon hardest,
by the rest of Europe. A portion of their antipathy
is owing to this idea, though the idea itself
is altogether owing to their prejudices against America,
for there is not a particle of truth in it. I do
not remember to have conversed on the subject,
with any Englishman, who did not betray this feeling.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
It is of no consequence, that dates disprove
the fact. America declared war, on the 18th of
June, 1812, after twenty years of submission to impressment,
and illegal captures, and at a moment
when the government was put in possession of proof
of an effort, on the part of England, to dissolve the
Union, as well as of her fixed determination, not
to alter her Orders in Council. As respects the
latter, history gives all the necessary evidence of
the expediency of the war, for it had not been declared
three months, when the British government
offered to do, what it had just before officially affirmed
it would not do. In June 1812, Spain and
Portugal were in arms, on the side of England,
Russia and Sweden, were secretly preparing to join
her, and that great effort which finally broke down
the power of France, was just about to commence.
But in the face of all these facts, the opinion I
have mentioned, certainly exists.</p>

<p>The English have been persuaded that a religious
establishment is indispensable to religion. As
regards the establishments of Italy, France, Spain,
Turkey, and all the rest of the world, they are ready
enough to admit that there are capital faults, connected
with the several religious systems, but having
got the truth themselves, it is expedient to fortify it
with legal and exclusive advantages. Of all the
profane blasphemies the world has witnessed, that
of prostituting the meek doctrines of Christ, by
pampering his professed ministers with riches and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
honours, under the hollow pretence of upholding
his faith, is the most insulting to evident truths, and
offensive to humility. Such are the fruits of establishments,
and of enlisting religion in the support
of temporal political systems. Good men <em>may</em>
prosper, even under these disadvantages, but bad
men <em>will</em>. It is a device of the devil, if that fallen
angel is, at all, permitted to meddle with spiritual
things.</p>

<p>As we have no establishment, it is the prevalent
opinion, here, that we have no religion. Several
intelligent English, have confessed this much to me;
an admission that was not at all necessary, for I detected
the prejudice, before I had been a month in
the country: and one person has actually appealed
to me for facts, with a view to repel the arguments
of those who uphold the present state of things;
since it is assumed, that the actual condition of
America, is a proof of the necessity of a religious
establishment, in the interests of order and morality.
My answer was, “that were the upper classes of
the English, to be placed in America, with their
present habits and notions, there is not one of them
in a hundred, who would not immediately begin to
declaim against the religious fanaticisms and exaggeration
of the country!” This reply, I believe,
to contain the truth. There is an exterior affectation
of a deference for spiritual things, here, among
people of condition, that does not always, or rather
so universally exist with us; for, the government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
being an aristocracy, and the establishment enlisted
in its support, it would be a singular indiscretion,
in times like these, for those who reap the
peculiar advantages of the existing order of things,
to neglect so powerful an ally. Some of these persons,
often remind me of that anecdote of the English
sailor, who, falling into the hands of the
Turks, was urged to become a mussulman—“What,
change my religion? No, d—n my eyes, never.”
The religious <em>tone</em> of a community, is best ascertained
through its facts. Since I have been in Europe,
the following circumstances, among many others
of a similar character, have come under my eye.</p>

<p>A duel was fought at Boulogne in France, between
the Rev. —— ——, and Mr. ——; the
former was attended by his brother, the Rev. ——
——. Both the reverend gentlemen were ordained
clergymen of the church of England, and the latter
was said to be married to the daughter of a bishop.</p>

<p>A complainant appeared before a London magistrate,
in the case of an assault. The defendant justified
himself, by saying, “that he was driving a
gig, with a female; that the complainant passed
him on horseback repeatedly, and insulted his companion,
by staring under her hat; whereupon he
horsewhipped the offender.” “You handed this
card to your assailant?” said the magistrate, to the
complainant. “I did.” “With what intention?”
“As is usual among gentlemen, when an outrage
like this has been committed.” “One corner of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
the card is torn off—why did you tear it off!”
“<em>Because I am in the church</em>, sir, and I thought
the <em>‘Rev.’ misplaced on such an occasion</em>.” The
substance of this statement, with the names of the
parties, has appeared in the police reports, during
my visit here.</p>

<p>“The Rev. Mr. O——, fought Mr. ——, at Boulogne,
quite recently, the reverend gentleman hitting
his man.”</p>

<p>There is, no doubt, much vice among the clergy
every where, for they are frail, like all of us.
Probably the vicious men in the church of England,
are not at all more numerous, than those of every
established church necessarily must be, with the
temptations to enter it for the possession of rich
livings. But what I wish to lay before you, is a
comparison between England and America on these
points. I think, it would be hard to find a layman
in all America, who would fight a clergyman; much
less a clergyman who would openly fight a duel.
If “hypocrisy be the homage which vice pays to
virtue,” the inference is fair, that a public sentiment
in America, keeps a clergyman in closer
bounds, than he would be kept in England.</p>

<p>It is denying the effects of the most common natural
influences, to pretend that a church, whose
avenues lead to vast wealth, and to the highest rank
in the state, is as likely to be as pure in its ministers,
as one which offers less temporal inducements
than any one of all the liberal occupations of life.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
If it be contended that an establishment is indispensable
to religion, it must be confessed that its
advantages are to be taken with this essential drawback.
It is a notorious fact, that sons are set aside
for the church here when children, in order that
they may receive particular livings, in the gift of
the family, or its friends, or that their fortunes may
be pushed in it, by family influence. Nothing of the
sort exists with us.</p>

<p>Lord ——, at a dinner in his own house, observed
to me, that the best thing we had in America
was our freedom from the weight of a religious establishment.
Encouraged by this remark, I told an
anecdote of a conversation I had once overheard in
America. It was while making a passage in a sloop,
on the coast, with two young whalers, just returned
from sea, as fellow-passengers. A gentleman on board
asked me what had become of young Napoleon,
then a boy of ten or twelve years. I answered,
there was a report that the Austrians were educating
him for the church. My two whalers listened
intently to this conversation, in which the tender
years of the child had been mentioned, when one
of them suddenly exclaimed to the other—“Did
you hear that, Ben? Bringing a parson <em>up by
hand</em>!”—“Ay, ay; making a <em>cosset</em>-priest!”</p>

<p>I was much amused by the point and sarcasm of
these remarks, and every American will feel why;
but, I was more so, I think, by the manner in
which my English auditors received the anecdote.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
I do not think one of them felt its point; but as
the Sag-Harbour-men used agricultural figures to
illustrate their meaning, I was at once applied to, to
know whether such people could be more than
half-seamen, and whether America could supply
mariners sufficient to become a great naval power!</p>

<p>A lady, here, with whom I am on sufficiently
friendly terms to converse freely, was speaking of
the son of a noble family, a near connexion of hers,
who is in the church. “It is very unpleasant,”
she said, “to find one whom you esteem, getting to
be wrong-headed in such matters. Now —— was
becoming quite serious, and a little fanatical,
and I was employed by the family to speak to
him!” This ——, is a clergyman whose piety
has been highly extolled by one of our bishops, and
whose devotion to the Redeemer is thought, at home,
to be highly creditable to the English aristocracy.
So far as he himself is concerned, all this is well
enough; but as to the manner in which “the
nobility and gentry,” of his connexion, regard his
course, you have sufficient proof in what I have
just told you.</p>

<p>I shall dismiss this part of the subject as unpleasant
to myself. The Church of England, so far as
its religious dogmas are concerned, is that in which
I was educated, and in which I am training my
children; and no one is more sensible of its excellencies,
when they are separated from its abuses. I
should have been silent, altogether, on its defects,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
but I feel convinced that a grasping, worldly spirit,
has made it an instrument, in the hands of artful or
prejudiced men, of defaming a state of society
which is probably as exempt from its own peculiar
vices, as it ever fell to the lot of men to be.</p>

<p>Another notion deeply rooted in the English
mind, is a strange opinion, that all men of <em>liberal</em>
education and gentlemanly habits, must, of
necessity, be hostile to popular rights, and, by the
same necessity, advocates of some such liberty as
their own, if the advocates of any liberty at all.
One of the first things that the clerical critic, on the
well-known sermon of Bishop Hobart, remarks, is
his surprise that a man of “gentlemanly habits”
should have taken such a view of matters! There
is, unquestionably, a strong disposition in men, who
do not look beyond the exterior of things, (and this,
perhaps, embraces the majority,) to confound “taste”
with “principles.” There are many things in which
the results of the English system are more agreeable
to my tastes, and even my habits, than those
of our own, though I believe ours will be eventually
softened by the pressure of society; but, it
does not strike me that this is a sufficient reason,
why an honest man should overlook more essential
points. One cannot have the thorough, social
drilling of a government of exclusion, and escape
its other consequences. All power that is not based
on the mass, must repress the energies and moral
improvement of that mass for its own security, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
the fruits are the vast chasm which exists every where,
in Europe, between the extremes of society.</p>

<p>I shall say little of the mere vulgar prejudices,
which piously believe in the inherent superiority,
moral and physical, of Englishmen over all the
rest of mankind; for something very like it is
to be found in all nations. Still, I think, the prejudices
of England, in this respect, are more than
usually offensive to other people, as, I believe, are
our own. Those of England, however, are to be
distinguished from those of America, in one important
particular. The common Englishman cannot
believe himself superior to his transatlantic kinsman,
with a whit more sincerity, than the feeling
is returned by the common American. But, while
the Englishman of the upper classes thinks lightly
of the American, the American of the upper classes
over-estimates the Englishman. There are doubtless
many exceptions, in both cases, especially
among those who have travelled; but such, I think,
is the rule. Our own weakness is a natural consequence
of a colonial origin, of reading English
books, and of the exaggerations of distance and
dependency. It is a weakness that is seen and
commented on, by every body but those who
feel it.</p>

<p>I question if the inbred and overweening notion
of personal superiority ascends as high in the social
scale, or is as general among people of education,
in any other community, as in England. In this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
respect, we are deficient rather than exaggerated;
for while all America (I now speak of the upper
classes, you will remember) can be thrown into a
fever, by an intimation that our <em>things</em> are not as
good as those of other nations, there is a secret and
general distrust of our equality on the points that
alone can give dignity and character to man. A
friend of yours has been accused of national vanity,
and national conceit, (an odd charge, by the way, for
I question if there is a man in the whole republic
who prides himself less in the national character,
than the person in question,) because he has
endeavoured to repel and refute some of the
grosser imputations that artifice and prejudice, in
this quarter of the world, have been studiously
and industriously heaping on us; and the simple
circumstance that, in so doing, he has conflicted a
little with English supremacy, has been the means
of destroying whatever favour he may once have
possessed with the American <em>reading</em> public, as a
writer; for England, at this moment, holds completely
at her mercy the reputation and character
of every American she may choose to assail, who
is not supported by the <em>bulk</em> of his own nation.
As a matter of course, she writes up all who defer
to her power, and writes down all who resist it. The
statements of your friend have been publicly derided,
because they have affirmed the rights and merits of
the <em>mass</em>, on which alone we are to ground all our
claims to comparative excellence; and I now ask<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
you, if, in any review, comment, or speech, at
home, you have ever met with the sweeping
assertions of an <em>abstract</em>, <em>innate</em> national superiority,
that is contained in the following paragraph.</p>

<p>“It would be in vain to inquire whether this
superiority, which we do not hesitate to say has
been made manifest, with very few exceptions,
whenever the British have met foreign troops upon
equal terms, arises from a stronger conformation of
body, or a more determined turn of mind; but
it seems certain that the British soldier, inferior to
Frenchmen in general intelligence, and in individual
acquaintance with the trade of war, has a decided
advantage in the bloody shock of actual conflict,
and especially when maintained by the bayonet,
body to body. <em>It is remarkable also, that the
charm is not peculiar to any one of the three
united nations, but it is common to the natives
of all, different as they are in habits and education.</em>
The guards, supplied by the city of London,
may be contrasted with a regiment of Irish recruited
among their rich meadows, or a body of Scotch,
from their native wildernesses; and while it may
be difficult to assign the palm to either over the
other two, all are found to exhibit that species of
dogged and desperate courage, <em>which without staying
to measure force or calculate chances, rushes
on the enemy as the bull-dog upon the bear</em>.”</p>

<p>Lest you should think I have rummaged one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
of the productions of the Minerva Press, for
some of its inflations, it may be well to explain,
that this quiet, deeply-seated <em>naïve</em> proof of ignorance
and prejudice, is quoted from Sir Walter
Scott’s account of the battle of Maida, in the Life
of Napoleon. We are justly enough deemed conceited,
but our literature contains nothing to compare
with this. I have cited this instance of prejudice,
in order to prove how high the weakness of believing
in the personal superiority of their own people,
ascends in the scale of intellect, for I have no doubt,
that Sir Walter Scott religiously believed all he
wrote.</p>

<p>The exhibition of many of the prejudices of the
English, are not always restrained by propriety,
even among those who ought to know better.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
Of this, all foreigners complain, and I think, with
reason. As respects us, there is a quiet assumption
of superiority, that has the appearance of an established
right to comment on the nation, its character,
and its institutions. There is a mode of doing
this, which removes all objections, among men of
the world, but there is, also, a mode which amounts
to positive personal disrespect.</p>

<p>Of the latter class, is an occurrence that took
place at the table of Lord ——, quite lately. One of
the guests very quietly went to work, without preface
of any sort, to prove, that the improper deportment
of the members of congress, as compared with
those of parliament, was owing to a want of refinement
in the nation! I met him at once (for I never
witnessed in the society of gentlemen, a greater instance
of personal indecorum,) by denying his
premises. Seriously, I believe, of the two, congress
is better mannered than parliament, though
there is less mystification; all that has been written
to the contrary, being founded rather on what ought
to be, according to certain notions, than on what is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>Whenever I meet with this disposition, it chills
all my sympathies. I hope I can be just to such
men, but I can never like them. What renders
these unfeeling and ignorant comments less inexcusable,
is the fact, that any attempt to turn the
tables, is instantly met with a silence that cannot be
misconstrued. Surprised to find the depth, and
universality of prejudice against America, here, as
well as the freedom with which remarks are made,
I determined to try the experiment of retorting in
kind. In most instances, I have found that they who
were willing to talk all night, on the defects of
America, become mum, the instant there is an allusion
to any similar weaknesses in England, or in
English character. As there can be no wish to keep
up acquaintances, on such terms, I have generally
dropped them; always unless I have seen that the
prejudice is sincere, and acting on a benevolent nature.
I presume the history of the world, cannot
offer another instance of prejudice in one nation
against another, that is as strong and as general, as
that which, at this moment, exists in England against
America; the community of language, and the art
of printing, having been the means of provoking,
rather than of mitigating the failing.</p>

<p>Although prejudice must result in ultimate evil,
it may measurably produce intermediate good. The
prejudices of England are at the base of the nationality
of her people. With us the <em>people</em> are national,
from affection, and a consciousness of living<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
under a system that protects their rights and interests.
But true nationality is very much confined
to the mass, though national conceit is pretty generally
diffused. No man in America, can have national
pride, (the ground-work of all true nationality,)
who has not pride in the institutions; and this
is a feeling that all the training of the higher classes
has taught them to repress. Our social aristocracy,
in this respect, are a mere reflection of the commoner
English prejudices—prejudices that are received
ignorantly, in pure faith, and as the stone
admits water by constant dropping. A more impudent
piece of literary empiricism has never been
palmed on the world, than the pretension that the
American reading public requires American themes;
it may require American <em>things</em>, to a certain extent,
though its quite natural and perhaps excusable that
it should prefer foreign, which I believe to be the
real fact; but as to distinctive American <em>sentiments</em>
and American <em>principles</em>, the majority of that class
of our citizens, hardly know them when they see
them. A more wrong-headed and deluded people
there is not, on earth, than our own, on all such
subjects, and one would be almost content to take
some of the English prejudices, if more manliness
and discrimination could be had with them. Our
faults of this nature, are the results of origin and geographical
position; those of England are the results
of time, power, artifice, and peculiar political and
physical advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>All great nations are egotistical, and deluded on
the subject of their superiority. The constant influence
of an active corps of writers, (who from position
become so many popular flatterers,) acting on
the facts of a strong community, has a tendency to
induce men to transfer the credit that is only due to
collective power, to national character and personal
qualities. The history of the world proves that the
citizens of small states have performed more great
and illustrious personal acts, and out of all proportion
to numbers, than the citizens of great nations, and the
reason is probably to be found in the greater necessities
of their condition; but, fewer feeling an interest
in extolling their deeds, it is not common for
them to reap the glory that falls to the share of even
the less deserving servitors of a powerful community.</p>

<p>I shall close this brief summary of national peculiarities,
by an allusion to one more. Foreigners
accuse the English of being capricious in their ordinary
intercourse. They are allowed to be fast
friends, but uncertain acquaintances. The man, or
woman, who receives you to-day with a frank smile,
and a familiar shake of the hand, may meet you to-morrow
coldly, and with a chilling or repulsive formality.
I have seen something of this, and believe
the charge, in a degree, to be merited. They are
formalists in manners, and too often mistake the
spirit that ought to regulate intercourse. Jonathan
stands these caprices better than any one else, for
he is so devout a believer that he sees smiles in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
idol, when other people see grimaces. Your true
American <i lang="fr">doctrinaire</i> studies the book which John
Bull has published concerning his own merits, with
some such faith as old women look into the almanac
in order to know when it will snow.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<span class="fs70">HENRY FLOYD-JONES, ESQ., FORT NECK.</span></h2>


<p>Our connexion, Mr. McAdam,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> who resides in
Hertfordshire, has just taken me with him to his
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>It was something to find myself on an English
high-way, seated by the side of the man who had
done so much for the kingdom, in this respect.
We travelled in an open gig, for my companion
had an eye to every displaced stone, or inequality
in the surface. The system of roads, here, is as
bad as can be; the whole country being divided
into small “trusts,” as they are called, in a way
to prevent any one great and continued plan. I
should say we went through four or five gates,
absolutely within the limits of the town; obstacles,
however, that probably still exist, on account
of the great growth of London. Although Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
McAdam had no connexion with the “trusts”
about London, we passed all the gates without
contribution, in virtue of his name.</p>

<p>We had much conversation on the subject of
roads. On my mentioning that I had found some
of them much better than others, a few, indeed,
being no better than very many of our own, Mr.
McAdam told me that there was a want of material
in many parts of England, which had compelled
them to have recourse to gravel. “Now,” said he,
“the <em>metal</em> of this very road on which we are
travelling, came from the East Indies!” The
explanation was sufficiently simple; stone had
been brought into the India docks, as ballast, and
hauled thence, a distance of several miles, to make
the bed of the road we were on. Gravel-pits are
common in England; and there is one open, at this
moment, in Hyde Park, that is a blot on its verdure.</p>

<p>We took the road into Hertfordshire, which is the
great northern high-way, as well as being the scene
of John Gilpin’s race. We passed the “Bell, at
Edmonton,” where there is now a sign in commemoration
of John’s speed, and bottom, and wig.
By the way, the coachmen have a more classical
authority for the flaxens than I had thought.</p>

<p>Waltham cross was an object of still greater
interest. Edward I. caused these crosses to be erected
on the different spots where the body of his wife
reposed, in its funeral-journey from Milford Haven,
to London. Charing-cross, in the town itself, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
the last of them. They are little gothic structures,
with niches to receive statues, and are surmounted
by crosses, forming quaint and interesting memorials.
I believe we passed two of them between
London and Hoddesdon, by which it would seem
that the body of the queen made short stages. The
cross at Charing has entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>At Hoddesdon, we were on the borders of Essex,
and the day after our arrival, Mr. McAdam walked
with me across the bridge that separates the two
counties, to look at Rye-house, the place so celebrated
as the spot where the attempt was to have
been made on the life of Charles II. The intention
was to fire on the king, as he returned from Newmarket,
on his way to London. The building is
certainly well placed for such an object, as it almost
projects into the road, which, just here, is quite
narrow, and which it enfilades in such a way, that a
volley fired from its windows would have been
pretty certain to rake the whole of the royal <i lang="fr">cortège</i>.
The house, itself, is a common brick farm
building, somewhat quaint, particularly about the
chimneys, and by no means large. I suspect a
part of it has disappeared. It is now used as a
poor-house, and, certainly, if it is to be taken as a
specimen of the English poor-houses, in general,
it is highly creditable to the nation. Nothing
could be neater, and the inmates were few.</p>

<p>The land, around this place, was low and level,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
and quite devoid of landscape beauty. I was told
there is evidence that the Danes, in one of their
invasions, once landed near this spot, though the
distance to the sea cannot now be less than twenty
miles! Mr. Malthus has overlooked the growth
of the island, in his comparative estimates of the
increase of the population.</p>

<p>Some boys were fishing on the bridge, near Rye-house,
wearing a sort of uniform, and my companion
told me they were cadets studying for the East
India civil service, in an institution near by. The
New-river, which furnishes so much water to
London, flows by this spot, also; and, in returning,
we walked some distance on its banks. It is not
much larger than a race-way, nor was its current
very swift. If this artificial stream can even wash
the hands and faces of the cockneys, the Croton
ought to overflow New York.</p>

<p>Hoddesdon was selected as a residence, by several
of the American emigrant families, that were
driven from their own country, and lost their
estates, by the revolution. Its comparative cheapness
and proximity to London, must have been
its recommendation, as neither the place itself, nor
the surrounding country, struck me as particularly
attractive. The confiscations were peculiarly hard
on individuals; and in some instances they were
unmerited, even in a political point of view; but if
it be true, as has lately been asserted, that the
British ministry brought about the struggle under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
the expectation of being able easily to subdue the
colonists, and with a view to provide for their
friends by confiscations on the other side, retributive
justice did its usual office. The real history
of political events, would scarcely bare the light, in
any country.</p>

<p>If any American wishes to hear both sides of the
great contest between the colonies and the mother
country, I would recommend a short sojourn in
one of the places where these emigrants have left
their traditions. He will there find that names
which he has been taught to reverence are held in
hereditary abhorrence; that his heroes are other
people’s knaves, and other people’s prodigies his
rogues. There is, in all this, quite probably, the
usual admixture of truth and error, both heightened
by the zeal and animosities of partizanship.</p>

<p>I had, however, in our connexion, strong evidence
of how much the mind, unless stimulated by
particular motives, is prone to rest satisfied with its
acquisitions, and to think of things changeable in
their nature, under the influence of first impressions.
He is a man of liberal acquirements, sound judgment,
great integrity of feeling, and of unusually extensive
practical knowledge, and yet some of his notions
of America, which were obtained half a century
since, almost tempted me to doubt the existence
of his common sense. An acute observer, a
countryman long resident here, told me soon after
landing that “the English, clever, instructed, fair-minded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
and practical as they commonly are, seem
to take leave of their ordinary faculties, on all subjects
connected with America.” Really, I begin
to be of the same way of thinking.</p>

<p>Our connexion here, was as far from vapouring on
the subject of England, as any man I knew; of
great personal modesty and simplicity, he appears
to carry these qualities into his estimates of national
character. He is one of the few Englishmen, I
have met, for instance, who has been willing to
allow that Napoleon could have done any thing,
had he succeeded in reaching the island. “I do
not see how we should have prevented him from
going to London,” he said, “had he got a hundred
thousand men fairly on the land, at Dungenness; and
once in London, heaven knows what would have
followed.” This opinion struck me as a sound one,
for the nation is too rich, and the division between
<em>castes</em>, too marked, to expect a stout resistance,
when the ordinary combinations were defeated. I
have little doubt, that the difference in systematic
preparation and in the number of regular troops
apart, that a large body of hostile men, would
march further in England, than in the settled parts
of America, all the fanfaronades of the Quarterly,
to the contrary, notwithstanding. He looks on the
influence of the national debt too, gloomily, and is
as far from the vapid indifference of national vanity,
as any one I know. But, the moment we touch on
America, his mind appears to have lost its balance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
As a specimen of how long the old colonial maxims
have been continued in this country, he has asked
me where we are to get wool for our manufactures?
I reminded him of the extent of the country. This
was well enough, he answered, but “the winters are
too long in America to keep sheep.” When I told
him the census of 1825, shows that the single state
of New York, with a population of less than
1,800,000, has three millions and a half of sheep,
he could scarcely admit the validity of our documents.</p>

<p>All the ancient English opinions were formed on
the political system of the nation, and men endeavoured
lustily to persuade themselves that things
which this system opposed could not be. The necessity
of enlisting opinion in its behalf, has imposed
the additional necessity of sometimes enlisting
it, in opposition to reason.</p>

<p>There is a small building in Hoddesdon, called
Roydon-house, that has exceedingly struck my
fancy. It is not large for Europe, not at all larger
than a second-rate American country house, but
beautifully quaint and old fashioned. I have seen
a dozen of these houses, and I envy the English
their possession, much more than that of their Blenheims
and Eatons. I am told there is not a good
room in it, but that it is cut up, in the old way, into
closets, being half hall and stair case. The barrenness
of our country, in all such relics, give them
double value in my eyes, and I always feel, when I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
see one, as if I would rather live in its poetical and
antique discomfort, than in the best fitted dwelling
of our own times. I dare say a twelvemonth of
actual residence, however, would have the same
effect on such a taste as it has on love in a cottage.</p>

<p>I returned to town in a post-chaise, a vehicle that
the cockneys do not calumniate, when they call it
a “post <em>shay</em>.” It is a small cramped inconvenient
chariot without the box, and, like the <em>interiors</em> of
the ordinary stage-coaches, does discredit to the
well established reputation of England for comfort.
Those who use post-horses, in Europe, usually
travel in their own carriages, but these things are
kept, as <i lang="fr">pis allers</i> for emergencies.</p>

<p>As we drove through the long maze of villages,
that are fast getting to be incorporated with London
itself, my mind was insensibly led to ruminations
on the growth of this huge capital, its influence on
the nation and the civilized world, its origin and its
destinies.</p>

<p>To give you, in the first place, some idea of the
growth of the town, I had often heard a mutual connexion
of ours, who was educated in England,
allude to the circumstance that the husband of one
of his cousins, who held a place in the royal household,
had purchased a small property in the vicinity
of London, in order to give his children the benefit
of country air; his duties and his poverty equally
preventing him from buying a larger estate further
from town. When here, in 1826, I was invited to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
dine in the suburbs, and undertook to walk to the
villa, where I was expected. I lost my way, and
looking up at the first corner, for a direction, saw
the name of a family nearly connected with those
with whom we are connected. The three or four
streets that followed had also names of the same
sort, some of which were American. Struck by
the coincidence, I inquired in the neighbourhood,
and found I was on the property of the grandson of
the gentleman, who, fifty years before, had purchased
it with a view to give his children country
air! Thus the <em>poverty</em> of the ancestor has put the
descendant in possession of some fifteen or twenty
thousand a year.</p>

<p>I should think that the growth of London is
greater, relatively, than that of any other town in
Europe, three or four on this island excepted.
Many think the place already too large for the kingdom,
though the comparison is hardly just, the empire,
rather than England, composing the social
base of the capital. So long as the two Indies and
the other foreign dependencies can be retained,
London is more in proportion to the power and
wealth of the state, than Paris is in proportion
to the power and wealth of France. The day
must come, (and it is nearer than is commonly
thought) when the British Empire, as it is now
constituted, must break up, and then London will,
indeed, be found too large for the state. In that
day, its suburbs will probably recede quite as fast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
as they now grow. Mr. McAdam considers the
size of London an evil.</p>

<p>The English frequently discuss the usefulness of
their colonies, and moot the question of the policy
of throwing them off. They who support the latter
project, invariably quote the instance of America,
as a proof that the present colonies will be more
useful to the mother country, when independent,
than they are to-day. I have often smiled at their
reasoning, which betrays the usual ignorance of
things out of their own circle.</p>

<p>In the first place, England has very few real colonies
at this moment, among all her possessions. I
do not know where to look for a single foreign dependency
of her’s, that has not been wrested by
violence from some original possessor. It is true, that
time and activity have given to some of these conquests
the feelings and characters of colonies; and
Upper Canada, Nova Scotia, Jamaica, New Holland,
and possibly the Cape, are, more or less, acquiring
the title. I thought Mr. McAdam rather leaned to
the opinion, that the country would be better without
its colonies than with them. He instanced our
own case, and maintained that we are more profitable
to England now, than when we were her dependants.</p>

<p>All of the thirteen states of America were truly
English colonies. One only was a conquest, (New
York) but more than a century of possession had
given that one an English character, and the right
of conquest meeting with no obstacle in charters, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
more thoroughly English character too, by means of
a territorial aristocracy, than belonged to almost any
other. The force and impression of this strictly
colonial origin, are still be traced among us, in the
durability of our prejudices, and in the deference of
our opinions and habits to those of the mother country;
prejudices and a deference that half a century
of political facts, that are more antagonist to
those of England than any other known, so far from
overthrowing, has scarcely weakened.</p>

<p>In reviewing this subject, the extent and power
of the United States are also to be remembered.
Our independence was recognized in 1783. In 1793
commenced the wars of the French revolution.
About this time, also, we began the cultivation of
cotton. Keeping ourselves neutral, and profiting
by the national aptitude, the history of the world
does not present another instance of such a rapid relative
accumulation of wealth, as was made by America
between the years 1792 and 1812. It would
have been greater, certainly, had France and England
been more just, but, as it was, centuries will go
by before we see its parallel. Our naval stores,
bread stuffs, cotton, tobacco, ashes, indigo, and rice,
all went to the highest markets. Here, then, our
colonial origin and habits, stood England in hand.
Nineteen in twenty of our wants were supplied
<ins class="corr" id="tn-173" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'from her workships'">
from her workshops</ins>. Had we still been dependants we
could not have been neutral, could not have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
common carriers, could not have bought, for want
of the ability to sell.</p>

<p>Now, where is England, in her list of colonies, to
find a parallel to these facts? If the Canadas were
independent, what have they to export, that we
could not crush by competition? England may
take lumber exclusively from British America, as a
colony, but were British America independent, we
would not submit to such a regulation. Our southern
woods, among the best in the world, would drive
all northern woods out of the market. Having little
to sell, Canada could not buy, and she would begin,
in self-defence, to manufacture. Our manufactures
would deluge the West-India islands, our ships
would carry their produce, and, in short, all the
American possessions would naturally look up to the
greatest American state as to their natural head.</p>

<p>In the east, it would be still worse. All the
world would come in, as sharers of a commerce that
is now controlled for especial objects. England
would cease to be the mart of the world, and would
find herself left with certain expensive military establishments
that there would no longer be a motive
for maintaining. Were England to give up her dependencies,
I think she would sink to a second-rate
power in twenty years. Did we not exist, the
change might not be so rapid, for there would be
less danger from competition; but we <em>do</em> exist; number,
already, nearly as many people as England, and
in a quarter of a century more shall number as many
as all the British isles put together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>Can England retain her dependencies, in any
event? The chances are that she cannot. It is the
interest of all christendom to overturn her system,
for it is opposed to the rights of mankind, to allow
a small territory in Europe, to extend its possessions
and its commercial exclusion, over the whole earth,
by <em>conquest</em>. The view of this interest, may be
obscured by the momentary interference of more
pressing concerns, and the alliance of Great Britain
purchase temporary acquiescence, but as the world
advances in civilization, this exclusion will become
more painful, until all will unite, openly or secretly,
to get rid of it. Men are fast getting to be of less
importance, in Europe, and general interests are
assuming their proper power.</p>

<p>It is probable that England will find herself so
situated, long ere the close of this century, as to
render it necessary to abandon her colonial system.
When this is done, there will no longer be a motive
for retaining dependencies, that belong only to herself
in their charges. The dominion of the east will
probably fall into the hands of the half-castes; that of
the West Indies will belong to the blacks, and
British America is destined to be a counterpoise to
the country along the gulph of Mexico. The first
fleet of thirty sail of the line, that we shall send to
sea, will settle the question of English supremacy,
in our own hemisphere.</p>

<p>Were these great <ins class="corr" id="tn-175" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'results dependant'">
results dependent</ins> on the policy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
of America, I should greatly distrust them, for, no
nation has less care of its foreign interests, or looks
less into the future, than ourselves. We are nearly
destitute of statesmen, though overflowing with politicians.
But the facts of the republic are so stupendous
as to overshadow every thing within their
influence. This is another feature, in which the
two countries are as unlike as possible. Here all
depends on men; on combinations, management,
forethought, care, and policy. With us, the young
Hercules, is stripped of his swaddlings, and his
limbs and form are suffered to take the proportions
and shape of nature. To be less figurative—it is a
known fact that our exertions are proportioned to
our wants. In nothing is this truth more manifest,
than in the difference which exists between the
foreign policies of England and America. That of
this country has all the vigilance, decision, energy,
and system that are necessary to an empire so factitious
and of interests so diversified, while our own
is marked by the carelessness and neglect, not to
say ignorance, with which a vigorous youth, in the
pride of his years and strength, enters upon the
hazards and dangers of life. One of the best arguments
that can be adduced in favor of the present
form of the British government, is its admirable
adaptation to the means necessary for keeping such
an empire together. Democracy is utterly unsuited
to the system of metropolitan rule, since its maxims
imperiously require equality of rights. The secret<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
consciousness of this fitness, between the institutions
and the empire, will probably have a great effect on
the minds of all reflecting men in England, when
the question comes to serious changes; for the moment
the popular feeling gets the ascendancy, the
ties that connect the several parts of this vast collection
of conflicting interests, will be loosened. The
secrecy of motive, and the abandonment of the
commoner charities that are necessary for the control
of so complicated a machinery, <ins class="corr" id="tn-177" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'are incompatable'">
are incompatible</ins> with the publicity of a popular sway and the
ordinary sympathies of human nature.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Were London to fall into ruins, there would
probably be fewer of its remains left in a century,
than are now to be found of Rome. All the stuccoed
palaces, and Grecian façades of Regent’s street
and Regent’s Park, would dissolve under a
few changes of the season. The noble bridges, St.
Paul’s, the Abbey, and a few other edifices would
remain for the curious; but, I think, few European
capitals would relatively leave so little behind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
them, of a physical nature, for the admiration of
posterity. Not so, however, in matters, less material.
The direct and familiar moral influence of
London is probably less than that of Paris, but in
all the higher points of character, I should think it
unequalled by that of Rome, itself.</p>

<span class="fs70">TO R. COOPER, ESQ., COOPERSTOWN, N. Y.</span></h2>


<p>Mr. Sotheby has had the good nature to take
me with him, to see Mr. Coleridge, at Highgate.
We found the bard living in a sort of New England
house, that stands on what, in New England,
would be called a green. The demon of
speculation, however, was at work in the neighbourhood,
and the place was <em>being</em> disfigured by
trenches, timber, and bricks.</p>

<p>Our reception was frank and friendly, the poet
coming out to us in his morning undress, without
affectation, and in a very prosaic manner. Seeing
a beautifully coloured little picture in the room, I
rose to take a nearer view of it, when Mr. Coleridge
told me it was by his friend Alston. It
was a group of horsemen, returning from the chase,
the centre of light being a beautiful grey horse.
Mr. Alston had found this horse in some picture of
Titian’s, and copied it for a study; but on Mr.
Coleridge’s admiring it greatly, he had painted in
two or three figures, with another horse or two, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
as to tell a story, and presented it to his friend. Of
this little work, Mr. Coleridge told the following
singular anecdote.</p>

<p>A picture-dealer, of great skill in his calling, was
in the habit of visiting the poet. One day this
person entered, and his eye fell on the picture for
the first time. “As I live!” he exclaimed, “a
real Titian!” Mr. Coleridge was then eagerly
questioned, as to where he had found the jewel,
how long he had owned it, and by what means it
came into his possession. Suddenly, the man
paused, looked intently at the picture, <em>turned his
back towards it, as if to neutralize the effect of
sight</em>, and raising his hand, so as to feel the surface
over his shoulder, he burst out in an ecstacy of astonishment,
“It has not been painted twenty years!”</p>

<p>This story was told with great unction and a
suitable action, and embellished with what a puritan
would deem almost an oath. We then adjourned
to the library. Here we sat half an hour, during
most of which time, our host entertained us with
his flow of language. I was amused with the contrast
between the two poets, for Mr. Sotheby was as
meek, quiet, subdued, simple, and regulated, as the
other was redundant, imaginative, and overflowing.
I thought the first occasionally checked the natural
ebullitions of the latter, like a friend who rebuked
his failings. One instance was a little odd, and
pointed.</p>

<p>The conversation had wandered to phrenology,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
and Mr. Coleridge gave an account of the wonders
that a professor had found in his own head, with a
minuteness that caused his friend to fidget. To divert
him from the subject, I told an anecdote that
occurred just before I left America.</p>

<p>Meeting a votary of the science, one day, at a
bookseller’s, he began to expatiate on it’s beauties.
From theory he proceeded to practice, by making
an analysis of my bumps. Tired of the manipulation,
I turned him over to the head of the bookseller,
who was standing by, professing to be a
better judge of another man’s qualities, than of my
own. Now this bookseller was a singularly devout
man, and the phrenologist instinctively sought the
bump of veneration, as the other bowed his head
for him to feel it. The moment the fingers of the
phrenologist touched the head, however, I saw
that something was wrong, and I had the curiosity
to put my own hand to the scull. In the spot
where there should have been a bump, according
to theory, there was positively a hollow. I looked
at the phrenologist, and the phrenologist looked at
me. At this moment, the bookseller was called
away by a customer, and I said to my acquaintance,
“well, what do you say to that?” “Say?—That
I have no faith in that fellow’s religion!”</p>

<p>Both the gentlemen laughed at this story, but
Mr. Sotheby gave it a point, that I had not anticipated,
by intimating to Mr. Coleridge, pretty
plainly, that when one discussed the subject of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
phrenology, he should not introduce his own bumps,
as the subject of the experiments. Notwithstanding
two or three little rebukes of this nature, the poets
got on very well together; and finding that they
had some rhymes to arrange between them, I left
them to discuss the matter by themselves.</p>

<p>This was a poetical morning, for, on leaving Mr.
Coleridge, we drove to the house of Miss Joanna
Baillie, at Hampstead, a village that lies on the
same range of low heights. Luckily, we found
this clever, and respectable, and simple-minded
woman in, and were admitted. I never knew a
person of real genius who had any of the affectations
of the smaller fry, on the subject of their feelings
and sentiments. If Coleridge was scholastic
and redundant, it was because he could not help
himself; to use a homely figure, it was a sort of
boiling over of the pot on account of the intense
heat beneath.</p>

<p>It has often been my luckless fortune to meet
with ladies who have achieved a common-place
novel, or so, or who have written a Julia, or a Matilda,
for a magazine, and who have ever after
deemed it befitting their solemn vocation to assume
lofty and didactic manners; but Miss Baillie had
none of this. She is a little, quiet, feminine woman,
who you would think might shrink from
grappling with the horrors of a tragedy, and whom
it would be possible to mistake for the maiden sister
of the curate, bent only on her homely duties.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
Notwithstanding this simplicity, however, there
was a deeply-seated earnestness about her, that bespoke
the good-faith and honesty of the higher impulses
within.</p>

<p>After all, is it not these impulses that make what
the world calls genius? All men are sensible of
truths, when they are fairly presented to them, and
is the difference between the select few, and the
many, any more than a quickening of the powers,
by some physical incentive, which, in setting the
whole in motion, throws into stronger light than
common, the inventive, the beautiful, and the sublime?</p>

<p>Let this be as it may, Miss Joanna Baillie had to
me, the air and appearance of a quiet enthusiast.
She went with us to look at the village, and, as she
walked ahead, to do the honours of the place,
in her plain dark hat and cloak, I am certain, no
one, at a glance, would have thought her little person
contained the elements of a tragedy.</p>

<p>Something was said of a sketch of Napoleon, by
Dr. Channing; a work I had not seen. Miss Baillie
allowed that it was clever, but objected to some
one of its positions, that, though it was right enough
for an American, it was not so right for an Englishman.
As I had never read the sketch, in question,
I cannot tell you the precise point to which she alluded,
and I mention it, as another proof of a tone
of reasoning that is sufficiently common here, by
which there is an <em>abstract</em>, and a <i lang="la">quo ad hoc</i> right,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
in all things that touch political systems. This peculiarity
has frequently struck me, and I think it
so marked, as to merit notice. I take it to be the
inevitable consequence of all systems, in which the
reasoning is adapted to the facts, and not the facts
to the reasoning.</p>

<p>As we returned to town, we passed a group in
which there was a ring for a boxing match. Not a
prize fight, but a set-too, in anger. Mr. Sotheby
expressed a very natural disgust, at this <em>human</em>,
tendency, (not <em>inhuman</em>, remember,) and, then,
with an exquisite <i lang="fr">naïveté</i>, sympathized with me on
the state of things, in this respect, in America, with
some sufficiently obvious allusions to gouging!
Although, I have not passed ten months in England,
in the course of four visits, I believe I have witnessed
more fighting in it, between men, than I
ever saw in America. But of what use is it to tell
this, here? We are democrats, and bound by all
the pandects of monarchical and aristocratical opinion,
to be truculent and quarrelsome; as, having
no establishment, we are bound to be irreligious;
and, so far from gaining credit, I should be set
down, as one too sensitive to see the faults of his
own country.</p>

<p>Conversing with a very clever woman, the
other day, on the subject of field sports, she gave
a sudden shudder, and exclaimed—“but, then your
rattlesnakes!” I laughed, and told her, that I had
never seen a rattlesnake, out of a cage, and that,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
particular places excepted, in a country nearly as
large as Europe, they were unknown in America.
She shook her head incredulously, closing the conversation,
by observing, “that a <em>country</em>, which
contained rattlesnakes, could scarcely be agreeable
to walk in.”—What are a thousand leagues to such
an opinion?</p>

<p>Such notions is the American condemned to
meet with, here, not only daily, but hourly, and
without ceasing, if he should mingle with the people.
The prejudices of the English, against us,
against the land in which we live, against the entire
nation, morally, physically, and politically, circulate
in their mental systems, like the blood in their
veins, until they become as inseparable from the
thoughts and feelings, as the fluid of life is indispensable
to vitality. I say it, not in anger, but in
sorrow, when I tell you, that I do not believe the
annals of the world can present another such instance
of a people, so blindly, ignorantly, and
culpably misjudging a friendly nation, as the
manner in which England, at this moment, in
nearly all things, misjudges us. And yet, with
this fact staring us in the face, known to every man
who visits the country, a few <i lang="fr">serviles</i> excepted, told
to us by all foreigners, and as obvious as the sun
at noon day, there is not, probably, an American,
with the exception of political men who are sustained
by party, that has a name of sufficient reputation
to reach these shores, who does not hold his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
reputation at home, not only at the mercy of this
country, but at the mercy of any miscreant in it,
who may choose to insert three or four paragraphs,
to his credit or discredit, in any of the periodicals
of the day! Really, one is tempted to exclaim
with that countryman, who heard a salute from a
seventy-four, “now, do I know, we are a great
people!”</p>

<p>My admiration of the growth and immensity of
London, increases every time I have occasion to
pass its frontiers. I was struck with a remark made
to me, here, by Lord H——, who said—“the
want of a capital is one of the greatest difficulties,
with which you have to contend in America.” Of
course, he meant by a capital, not a seat of government,
but a large town, in which the intelligence
and influence of the country, periodically assembled,
and whence both might radiate, like warmth
from the sun, throughout the nation.</p>

<p>It is not easy for any but close observers, to estimate
the influence of such places as London and
Paris. They contribute, essentially, to national
identity, and national tone, and national policy: in
short, to nationality—a merit in which we are almost
entirely wanting. I do not mean national sensitiveness,
which some fancy is patriotism, though
merely provincial jealousy, but that comprehensive
unity of feeling and understanding, that renders a
people alive to its true dignity and interests, and
prompt to sustain them, as well as independent in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
their opinions. We are even worse off, than most
other nations would be without a capital, for we
have an anomalous principle of <em>dispersion</em> in the
state capitals. In nothing is the American government
more wanting, than in tone in all its foreign
relations. What American, out of his own country,
feels any dependance on its protection? No
one, who has any knowledge of its real action.
Such an accumulation of wrongs may be made, as
to touch the community, and then it is ready enough
to fight; but the <em>individual</em>, who should urge his
own injuries on the nation, as a case that called for
interference, would be crushed by the antagonist
interests of commerce, which is now the only collected
and concentrated interest of the nation. An
Englishman, or a Frenchman, goes into distant
countries, with a consciousness that he leaves behind
him, a concentrated and powerful sentiment
of nationality, that will throw its protection around
him, even to the remotest verge of civilization, but
the case is altogether different with the American.
If a man of reflection and knowledge, he knows
that there is no concentrated feeling, at home, to
sustain him; that the moment any case arises to set
his claims to justice in opposition to the trading
interests, he becomes obnoxious to the plastic ethics
of commerce, and that there is no condensed community
to sustain the government, in doing what is
clearly its duty, and what may even be its inclination.
Public opinion, half the time, is formed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
America, by downright, impudent simulations; for
little more is necessary than to assert, that Boston
and Philadelphia think so and so, to get New York
to join the cry. Such things are not so easily practised
in a capital, where the intelligence of a nation
is concentrated, which is the focus of facts, and,
where men become habituated to the arts of the intriguing
and selfish. I believe Lord H—— is right,
and that the want of a capital, on a scale commensurate
with that of the nation, is, indeed, one of the
greatest difficulties, with which we have to contend.
We shall never become truly a nation, until we get
one. These notions will, probably, seem odd, and
certainly new to you, as indeed they are new to
me; but it is not a good mode of getting correct
ideas of even oneself, to remain always at one’s
own fireside.</p>

<span class="fs70">J. E. DE KAY, ESQUIRE, NEW YORK.</span></h2>


<p>Mr. Rogers came to me the other evening, on
one of his friendly visitations, and I went out with
him, not well knowing what was to be the result of
it. We trot along the streets, together, he a little
on the lead, for he is a capital and an earnest
walker, and I in the rear, getting over the pavement
at the rate of four miles the hour.</p>

<p>London has certain private ways, called passages
I believe, by which one can avoid the carriages and
much of the streets, besides greatly shortening the
distances. We took to a line of these passages,
and came out in Leicester Square. Crossing this,
we pursued our way as far as the theatres, and entered
that of Covent Garden. As I had nothing to
do, but to follow my leader, who had certain signals,
by means of which he appeared to go just where he
pleased, I soon found myself in a private box, quite
near the stage, and nearly on a level with the pit.
There was a sedate elderly man in possession, already,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
but he proved to be an acquaintance of my
companion, who whispered a few words, and then
presented me to him, as to the vice chancellor, Sir
John Leach.</p>

<p>The play was intended to represent some of the
sports and practices of ancient London, but the
chief merit was the scenery. As it is fair to presume
that the best authorities had been consulted, I
had a great deal of pleasure in looking at the quaint
pictures that were successively presented to us, by
some of which, it was evident that our progenitors
built very much in the rude style that is still to be
seen in the towns of Picardy and Normandy, and
that, whatever, London may be now, she has not
always been a wonder of the world.</p>

<p>The house was much larger than any of our own,
it was better lighted, and had a neater and fresher
look, in despite of London and coal dust. The
audience was, quite evidently, composed of people
of a class much beneath the highest, still it had a
well-dressed and a respectable air, and, although its
taste was sometimes to be questioned, it was well
mannered. In short, it was very much like what our
own better theatres used to exhibit, before the inroad
of the Goths. The playing was scarcely to
be distinguished from what one usually sees in
America, though it was perhaps a little more decided
in its English tone. Mr. Charles Kemble
was among the actors. The circumstances that the
lower tier was reserved for people in evening dress,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
and that, the men sat with their hats off, gave the
spectacle an appearance of respectability and <em>comfort</em>
(to use an Anglicism) that is now seldom seen
in any of our own places of public resort.</p>

<p>It is an immense advantage to possess a National
Theatre. Our moralists have made a capital blunder
in setting their faces against the stage; since, while
demonstrating their own inability to put it down,
they have thrown it almost entirely into the hands of
those who look only to pecuniary advantages. It
should be patronized and regulated by the state, as
the best means of giving it a true direction, and of
checking, if not of totally repressing its abuses.
The common argument, that theatres are places of
resort for the vicious, and particularly for women of
light manners, is built on narrow views and great
ignorance of the world. In many countries, the
<em>churches</em> are used for the purposes of intrigue, and
yet it would hardly be thought a sufficient argument
for abandoning them entirely.</p>

<p>The English government retains a supervision of
the stage, a thing that is well enough if well managed;
but, in all countries in which the institutions
are not founded on the mass, the tendency of censorships
is to protect the systems, and, in order
to do this with the least odium, they get to be loose
on points that are more essential to a pure morality.
Vice is frequently thrown out as a sop, to keep the
mass quiet under the restraints of despotism.</p>

<p>We are still too young and too provincial for a
national theatre. Nothing can be safer than to write<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
or to talk in <em>praise</em> of America, and all it contains,
more especially of its <em>things</em>, but few men have yet
nerve enough to tell an unpalatable truth. We have
a one sided liberty of speech and of the press, that
renders every one right valorous in eulogies, but
even the pulpit shrinks from its sacred duties, on
many of the most besetting, the most palpable
and the most common of our vices. It is bold
enough, as to vague generalities, and sometimes as to
personalities, but who ever sees the caustic applied
to the public? The stage, a little later, may be made
the most efficient corrective of American manners,
but, in the true spirit of village resentment and
of provincial sensibilities, a dramatist could hardly
expose a failing, now, that the whole audience
would not be ready to cry out, “do you mean me
sir?”</p>

<p>We are much laughed at, here, just now, for the
manner in which the press is resenting the late book
of Captain Hall. No nation is very philosophical
under abuse, and certainly the English are surprisingly
thin-skinned for a people as proud, and possessing
so many just claims to greatness. The fact
is, both nations are singularly conceited on the
subject of national character, giving themselves
credit for a good many exclusive qualities to which
they have no exclusive pretensions, and by dint
of self glorification, in which the presses of the
two countries have been <ins class="corr" id="tn-192" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'particularily active, they they have'">
particularly active, they have</ins> got, at last, to look upon every man who
denies their exaggerated demands, as a sort of robber.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
Perhaps no other people praise themselves so
openly, offensively and industriously as those of
England and America, and I have no doubt the
newspapers are a principal cause that this failing
is so coarsely exhibited, for, as to its mere existence,
I fancy there is no great difference in the
amount of vanity, as between nations, or as between
individuals.</p>

<p>I have been much surprised, however, at observing
that, while all America appears to be up in
arms against Captain Hall, on account of his hits
at our manners, no one seems disposed to take up
the gauntlet in defence of the institutions! I know
no writer who is more vulnerable in his facts, or in
his reasoning on politics, than this gentleman, and
yet, while so much ink is shed in behalf of a gentility
and civilization that it would become us rather
to improve and refine, than to defend, the glorious
political facts of the country, are treated as if unworthy
of attention. Can all this proceed from the
circumstance that we are conscious the latter can
take care of themselves, while we secretly distrust
the claims of the former. No violence would be
done to human nature if this should actually be the
case.</p>

<p>The greatest objection I have to the book of Mr.
Hall, is that it <em>insinuates</em> more than it proves, or
even asserts. This is the worst species of detraction,
for it admits of neither refutation nor denial.
But I cannot express to you the disgust I have felt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
as a looker on at a distance, at reading in the journals
the mean spirited anticipations of what Mr.
Hall was to do for us, in the way of raising the
character of the nation, and the low personal abuse
that has succeeded, the moment it is found that
these anticipations are not realized. To be frank
with you, one appears to be as discreditable to the
tone, feelings, tastes, and facts of the nation as the
other.</p>

<p>It would be next to impossible for an Englishman,
on a short acquaintance, to like the state of society
that exists in America. I never knew one that did,
nor do I believe that it is agreeable to any European,
let him come from what part of Europe he will. It
is necessary that habit should smooth down many
asperities, before this can be the case; nor do I think
that many Americans like England, if they go beyond
the outside, until time has done a similar office
in its favour. I am not disposed to quarrel with
any Englishman, who says frankly, your society is
not to my liking; it wants order, tone, finish, simplicity,
and manliness; having substituted in their
stead, pretension, noise, a childish and rustic irritability,
and a confusion in classes. These defects are
so obvious to a man of the world, that one cannot
but distrust the declarations that are sometimes made
to the contrary. Notwithstanding this admission, I
have little doubt that most of the books of travels
that have been published in England, and in which
America has been held up to ridicule, have been addressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
to the prejudices of the nation; written in
that particular vein, because it has been believed it
would be more likely to please than any other.
Very few of them discover honesty of intention, a
trait that is usually detected even in the midst of blunders,
but it happens that this work of Captain Hall
does possess this redeeming quality.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The pronunciation of the stage is the same, here,
as it is with us. That of the world is not essentially
different from the best pronunciation of the Middle
States, though, in many respects, much better than
that of what is now called their <em>society</em>. Certainly,
as a nation, we speak better than the English, but it
is absurd to set up the general language of the educated
classes of America, as being as pure as the
language of the same classes here. I do not make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
this remark in reference to those words whose pronunciation
varies, but in reference to those concerning
whose provincialism there can be no dispute.
The women of this country have a distinct, quiet,
and regulated utterance, that is almost unknown in
their own sex in America. Their voices are more
like <em>contr’altos</em> than those of our women, who have
a very peculiar shrillness, and they manage them
much better. Indeed, we are almost in a state of
nature on all these points. The manners of the
country are decidedly worse now, in every thing,
than they were thirty years since; a fact, that must
be attributed to the <i lang="fr">pêle mêle</i> produced by a rapid
growth and extraordinary prosperity.</p>

<p>While on the subject of representations, I will
mention one that has been a little out of the usual
course, even for England. We have had a birthday
lately, and as George IV. seldom appears in
public, the festivities on this occasion have been
more than usually brilliant. One of the usages,
here, is to bring out young females, by presenting
them at court, and, so particular are the true adherents
to etiquette, that I am told many young ladies,
who have passed the proper age, have been waiting
two or three years for this ceremony, in order to make
their appearance in the world. At all events, every one
has seemed disposed to make the most of the opportunity
that has just offered, and we have had a
greater show of magnificence, and a much greater
throng of courtiers, than it is usual to see, even in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
this country, in which the king is probably as much
flattered as fettered.</p>

<p>As our residence is so near the palace, I had every
facility for seeing what was going on without putting
myself to inconvenience. One of the first movements
was the march of the horse-guards from their
barracks to the palace. These troops have a widespread
reputation for size and magnificence. They
are large men, certainly, but must be next to useless
in a campaign. Indeed, they are kept for state,
though they may be of service in quelling riots, in
a town like London; their appearance being well
adapted to terrifying an unarmed mob. In size,
they are considerably beyond the French <i lang="fr">gardes du
corps</i>, but the latter are very numerous, while there
cannot be more than a few hundred of the former.
Nor are these all English, for, walking behind two
of them, the other day, I overheard them speaking
like foreigners. They are probably picked up, like
the tall men of Frederic, wherever they can be found.
It is not impossible that there may be a stray Yankee
among them, as there are several in the French
army.</p>

<p>The march of these imposing troops was preceded
by a fine band on horseback, and the music was the
signal for the crowd to collect. There were two
ways of entering the palace, one private, and the
other public. The princes, foreign ministers, accompanied
by those they were about to present, the
great officers of the kingdom and court, and certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
of the privileged, used the former, while the more
common herd of courtiers went by the latter. The
first were set down in a court near what is called the
<em>stable-yard</em>, and the latter at the foot of St. James’
street.</p>

<p>There is a simple good sense, not to call it good
taste, that distinguishes the English from their more
ambitious kinsmen, our worthy selves, in all matters
connected with names. This of “stable-yard” is
one in point; for with us it would be the “stadium,”
or the “gymnasium,” if, indeed, it escaped being
called the “Campus Martius.” The tendency is
to exaggeration, in men, to whom learning, modes,
of living, and, indeed, most other things, are new,
and the mass being better educated than common
with us, without, however, being sufficiently educated
to create a taste for simplicity, and, at the same
time, having an usual influence, we are kept a little
more on stilts in such matters than one could wish.
This defect pervades the ordinary language of the
country too, and, sooner or later, will totally corrupt
it, if the proportion, of the unformed to the formed,
goes on increasing at the rate it has done for the last
ten years.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>I stood in the “stable-yard,” vulgar as the name
will sound to “ears polite,” witnessing the arrival
of princes, ambassadors, and dukes, and much
struck with the magnificence of their carriages.
Certainly, I had seen nothing equalling it, in Paris,
though the every day style of the King of France,
materially surpasses that of the King of England.
After all, I thought the gorgeous vehicles, with
their coronets rising above their tops, the gildings,
and the lace, much less pleasing than the simple
perfection of the common carriages of the country,
in which every thing is beautiful, because nothing
is overdone. M. de Polignac, and Prince Esterhazy,
were both present, the one as the French, the
other as the Austrian ambassador. The Duke of
Gloucester, the cousin and brother-in-law of the
king, came in state, as it is termed, having three
footmen, in elaborate liveries and wearing a sort of
jockey caps, instead of hats, clinging behind his
carriage. He was himself, a fine looking man, with
a good prominent profile, and a full contented face,
dressed in the uniform of a field marshal.</p>

<p>But I soon tired of the mere raree show. Accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
by a friend, I went round to the line of
carriages in St. James’s street, which, by this time,
could not set down the company nearly as fast, as
the vehicles arrived at the other end. There were
in fact, two lines, one in St. James’s street, and
the other in Pall Mall, and overhearing some
one speak of the great length of the former, we
determined to walk to the other extremity of it, as
the shortest method of satisfying our curiosity; to
receive the passing, instead of the standing salute.</p>

<p>I should think, that this one line of carriages
extended quite two miles. In the whole distance,
there was not a hackney coach, for London is as
unlike Paris, as possible, in this respect. The carriages,
for a great part of the distance, were drawn
up quite close to the side-walks, in order to leave
the centre of the streets free for the privileged to
come and go, and, perhaps, also, to permit a freer
circulation of the crowd. In consequence of the
wheels being nearly in the gutters, and the English
carriages being hung quite low, our heads were almost
on a level with those of the occupants of the
different equipages. In this manner, then, we
walked slowly along the line, examining the courtiers
at our leisure, by broad day-light, and much
nearer than we could have got to most of them, in
the palace. The crowd took it all in very good
part, appearing to regard it as an exhibition to which,
they were admitted gratis. Some of the people,
who, by the way, were well dressed, and well behaved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
as a whole, stood looking in at the carriage
windows, with quite as much coolness as if they
were the proprietors, chatting with their own
wives and daughters. Now and then, a footman
would remonstrate against the impertinence, but, in
the main, the women seemed resigned to their fate.
Similar liberties with us, would be natural excesses
of democracy! For the reasons already mentioned,
there was a larger proportion than common, of
young women to be presented, and it may be questioned
if the world could have offered a parallel to
the beauty and bloom, that were thus arrayed before
our eyes, I have elsewhere said that the English
females have the advantage of ours in high
dress, and this was altogether a ceremony in which
the advantage was of their side. I do not think,
that we could have shown as much beauty, in precisely
the same style, although, when one remembers
the difference between a scattered and a condensed
population, it becomes him to speak with caution,
on a point so delicate.</p>

<p>The ancient court dress, particularly that of the
women, has undergone some changes, of late, I
believe. I am told the hoop is done away with,
though it was not easy to ascertain the fact, to-day,
as I only saw the ladies seated. The <i lang="fr">coiffures</i> were
good, and the <i lang="fr">toilettes</i>, as a matter of course, magnificent.
Diamonds sparkled among eyes scarcely
less brilliant than themselves. In France, diamonds
are seldom used, except at court, though it is probable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
that they are oftener exhibited here, the
court being so secluded. On this occasion, however,
they were seen in great quantities, enthroned
on some of the fairest brows of Christendom.</p>

<p>The men, with the usual exceptions of those who
wore their regular professional attire, were all in the
well-known claret-coloured coat, steel buttons, bags,
swords, and embroidered vests. As many of those
who came alone, preferred walking to and from
their carriages, to waiting an hour for their approach,
we had a good many of these gentry in the
streets, where they gave the crowd a little of the
air of a carnival masquerade. There is great simplicity
in the dress of the men of England, however;
even on great occasions like this, much of the
more tawdry taste being reserved expressly for the
footmen.</p>

<p>But, apart from the lovely faces of the young
and fair of England, the out door glory of the day,
was borne away by the coachmen. Every one of
them had a new wig, and many of them capped
the flaxens with as rare specimens of castors, as
ever came out of a shop. It would be scarcely accurate
to call these hats cocked, for they were altogether
too <i lang="fr">coquet</i> and knowing, for a term so familiar.
Figure to yourself, the dignity of a portly
man of fifty, with a sky blue coat, laced on all its
seams, red plush breeches, white silk stockings,
shoebuckles as large as a muffin, a smug wig, a
shovel nosed hat, edged with broad gold lace, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
a short snub nose of his own, as red as a cherry,
and you will get some idea of these dignitaries.</p>

<p>When we had returned from examining the long
line of carriages, I met one of the princesses, in a
sedan chair, on her way from the palace to her own
residence. She was attended by six or eight footmen,
in the jockey caps, and scarlet liveries. Her
face was pallid and wrinkled, and as she was no
longer young, her appearance had that unearthly
and unseemly look, that always marks the incongruity
between age and the toilet. Some of the
most <em>uncomfortable</em>, (you see how English I am
getting,) some of the most <em>uncomfortable</em> objects
I have seen in Europe, have been women in the
“sear and yellow leaf,” tricked out for courts and
balls, and bedizened with paint and jewels. This
is a folly, at least, which we have as yet escaped,
for if we do abandon society to those who had
better be practising their <i lang="fr">gammes</i>, or kicking football
on a college green, we do not attempt to still the
thoughts of the grave, by these glaring and appalling
vanities.</p>

<p>The scene closed with a procession of mail
coaches, which, however neat and seemly the
set-outs, had too much the air of a cockney show,
to detain us from our dinner.</p>

<p>If the English are simple and tasteful in so much
of their magnificence, and, apart from its occasional
ponderousness, these are its prevailing characteristics,
they are more than usually studied and artificial,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
in extolling it, when all over. The papers
delight in the histories of great dinners, and fashionable
balls; and I have been solemnly assured,
there are people, that get into society, who are
actually guilty of the meanness of paying for the
insertion of their names in the list of the company
that is regularly published. As to a drawing-room
at court, it is a little fortune to the newsfinders. A
guinea introduces the name, five guineas insures
immortality to the dress, and ten brings in the
carriage. This, you will see, is making great men,
and great women, on a principle still unknown
with us, where we manufacture them in such quantities,
and swear they are the best in the market.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="LETTER_XXVI">LETTER XXVI.<br>
<span class="fs70">TO JAMES STEVENSON, ESQ., ALBANY, N. Y.</span></h2>


<p>The question is often asked, in what do the poor
of England suffer more than the poor of any other
country? I am not sufficiently versed in the details
connected with the subject, to speak with authority,
but I can give you the impressions received, as
a looker on.</p>

<p>In comparing the misery of England with that of
the continent of Europe, one must remember the
great difference of climate. A man suffers less at
Naples, without a coat or a fire, and with three <em>grani</em>
for his daily pittance, than is undergone in England,
beneath woollen, with ten <em>grani</em> to furnish the
“ways and means.” These facts make a great
moral difference in favour of England, when we
come to consider the merits of systems, though the
physical consequences may be against her.</p>

<p>The poor of this country appear to me to be over-worked.
They have little or no time for relaxation,
and instead of exhibiting that frank manly cheerfulness,
and heartiness of feeling, that have been so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
much extolled, they appear sullen, discontented, and
distrustful. There is far less confidence and sympathy
between classes, than I had expected to see, for,
although a good understanding may exist between
the great landholder, and the affluent yeoman who
pays him rent and farms the soil, the social chain
appears to be broken between those below the latter
and their superiors. I do not mean that the rich
are obdurate to the sufferings of the poor, but that
the artificial condition of the country has choked the
ordinary channels of sympathy, and that the latter,
when known at all, are known only as the <em>poor</em>.
They are the objects of duties, rather than fellow-creatures
living constantly within the influence of all
the charities, including those of communion and rights,
as well as those which are exhibited in donations.</p>

<p>There is one large class of beings, in England,
whose condition I should think less enviable than
that of Asiatic slaves. I allude to the female servants
of all work, in the families of those who keep
lodging-houses, tradesmen, and other small house-keepers.
These poor creatures have an air of dogged
sullen misery that I have never seen equalled, in
any other class of human beings, not even excepting
the beggars in the streets. In our lodgings at Southampton
there was one of these girls, and her hand
was never idle, her foot seemed to know no rest,
while her manner was that of wearied humility.
We were then fresh from home, and the unmitigated
toil of her existence struck us all most painfully.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
When we spoke to her kindly, she seemed startled,
and looked distrustful and frightened. A less inviting
subject for sympathy could scarcely be
imagined, for she was large, coarse, robust, and even
masculine, but even these iron qualities were taxed
beyond endurance.</p>

<p>I should not draw a picture like this, on the authority
of a single instance. I have seen too much
<ins class="corr" id="tn-207" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'to corrobate the'">
to corroborate the</ins> first impressions, and make no doubt
that the case of the woman at Southampton was the
rule, and that instances of better treatment make the
exceptions. In one of my bachelor visits here, I
had lodgings in which there was a still more painful
example. The mistress of this house was married
and had children, and being a lazy slattern, with
three sets of lodgings in the house, her tyranny exceeded
all I had ever before witnessed. You are to
understand that the solitary servant, in these houses,
is usually cook, house-maid, and waiter. When
the lodger keeps no servant, she answers his bell, as
well as the street door knocker, and goes on all his
errands that do not extend beyond a proper distance.
The girl was handsome, had much delicacy
of form and expression, and an eye that nature had
intended to be brilliant and spirited. She could not
be more than twenty-two or three, but misery had
already driven her to the bottle. I saw her only at
the street door, and on two or three occasions when
she answered my own bell, in the absence of my
man. At the street door, she stood with her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
on the carpet, and when I made my acknowledgments
for the trouble she had taken, she curtsied
hurriedly, and muttered the usual “Thankee, sir.”
When she came into my room it was on a sort of
drilled trot, as if she had been taught a particular
movement to denote assiduity and diligence, and she
never presumed to raise her eyes to mine, but stood
the whole time looking meekly down. For every
order I was duly thanked! One would think that
all this was hard to be borne, but, a day or two before
I left the house, I found her weeping in the
street. She had disobliged her lazy exacting mistress,
by staying out ten minutes too long on an
errand, and had lost her place. I took the occasion
to give her a few shillings as her due for past services,
but so complete was her misery in being turned
away without a character, that even the sight of
money failed to produce the usual effects. I make
little doubt she took refuge in gin, the bane of
thousands and tens of thousands of her sex, in this
huge theatre of misery and vice.</p>

<p>The order, method, and punctuality of the servants
of England are all admirable. These qualities probably
contribute quite as much to their own comfort
as to that of their masters and mistresses. It is seldom
that well-bred persons, anywhere, are unkind
to their menials, though they are sometimes exacting
through ignorance of the pain they are giving. The
tyranny comes from those who always appear to
feel a desire to revenge their own previous hardships,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
on the unfortunate creatures whom chance puts in
their power. I do not know that the English of
condition are unkind to their domestics; the inference
would fairly be that they are not; but there is
something, either in the system that has unfortunately
been adopted, or in the character of the people, which
has introduced a distance between the parties that
must be injurious to the character of those who serve.</p>

<p>On the continent of Europe the art of managing
domestics appears to be understood much better than
it is here. A body servant is considered as a sort of
humble friend, being treated with confidence but
without familiarity, nor can I say I have often witnessed
any want of proper respect on the part of the
domestics. The old Princesse de ——, who was a
model of grace and propriety in her deportment,
never came to see my wife, without saying something
kind or flattering to her <i lang="fr">femme de chambre</i>,
who usually admitted her and saw her out. A
French servant expects to be spoken to, when you
meet on the stairs, in the court, or in the garden,
and would be hurt without a “<i lang="fr">bon jour</i>” at meeting,
or an “<i lang="fr">adieu</i>” at parting. A French Duke
would be very apt to take off his hat, if he had occasion
to go into the porter’s lodge, or into the servant’s
hall; but I think very little of this courtesy
would be practised here. It is our misfortune to try
to imitate the English in this, as in other things, and
I make little question, one of the principal reasons
why our servants are so bad, is owing to their not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
being put on the proper footing of confidential dependants.</p>

<p>The comparison between the condition of the
common English house-servant, and that of the
American slave, is altogether in favour of the latter,
if the hardship of compelled servitude be kept out
of view. The negro, bond or free, is treated much
more kindly and with greater friendship, than most
of the English domestics; the difference in colour,
with the notions that have grown up under them,
removing all distrust of danger from familiarity.
This is not said with a view to turn the tables on our
kinsmen for their numberless taunts and continued
injustice; for, with such an object, I think something
more original and severe might easily be got up; but
simply because I believe it to be true. Perhaps the
servants of no country have more enviable places
than the American slaves, so far as mere treatment
and the amount of labour are concerned.</p>

<p>One prominent feature of poverty, in England,
<ins class="corr" id="tn-210" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'is dependant on'">
is dependent on</ins> causes which ought not to be ascribed
to the system. If a man can be content to live on
a few grapes, and a pound of coarse bread, and to
go without a coat, or a fire, in a region like that of
Naples, it does not necessarily follow, that another
ought to be able to do the same things in a country
in which there are no grapes, in which a fire is necessary,
and a coat indispensable. The high civilization
of England, unquestionably contributes also
to the misery of the very poor, by augmenting their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
wants, though it adds greatly to the comforts of
those who are able to sustain themselves. As
between the Americans and the English, it is not
saying much, under the peculiar circumstances of
their respective countries, that the poor of the
former are immeasurably better off than the poor of
the latter; but, apart from certain advantages of climate
in favour of the south of Europe, I am not at
all certain that the poor of England, as a body, do
not fare quite as well as the poor of any other part
of Christendom. I know little more of the matter,
however, than meets the eye of an ordinary traveller;
but, taking that as a guide, I think I should
prefer being a pauper in England, to being a beggar
in France. I now speak of physical sufferings
altogether, for on all points that relate to the feelings,
admitting that the miserable still retain any
sentiment on such points, I think England the least
desirable country, for a poor man, that I know.</p>

<p>The notion that so generally prevails in America,
on the subject of the independence and manliness
of the English, certainly does not apply to the body
of the poor, nor do I think the tradesmen, in general,
have as much of these qualities, as those of
France. The possession of their franchises, at a time
when such privileges were rare, may have given some
claims to a peculiar character of this nature, but
while the pressure of society has been gradually
weighing heavier and heavier on the nation, creating
the dependence of competition and poverty, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
lieu of that of political power, the other countries of
Europe have lessened their legal oppression, until,
I think, the comparison has got to be in their
favour. I should say there is quite as little manly
independence, in the intercourse between classes,
here, as in any country I have visited.</p>

<p>It is a common result of temporal advantages and
civilization, and, perhaps, to be accounted for on
obvious principles, that they should fail to bestow
the happiness at which we profess to aim. I do
not think that either the English or the Americans
are a happy people. The possession of a certain
physical civilization soon becomes necessary to our
wants, but we rather miss them when they are lost,
than enjoy them when possessed. In this particular,
Providence has singularly equalized the lot of
men, for being mere creatures of habit, advantages
of this kind neutralize themselves. The sort of
happiness that is dependent solely on material
things, after the first wants are supplied, is purely
relative, and the relation is to our knowledge,
rather than to any standard that exists in nature.
He who has appeased his hunger with bread, and
slaked his thirst with water, is just as well off, so
far as his appetites are concerned, as he who has
eaten a <i lang="fr">râgout</i>, and drunk Johannisberger. This
is said, however, solely in reference to hunger and
thirst, for I make little doubt character a good deal
depends on diet, and that the art with which materials<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
are put together, is of more consequence than the
viands themselves.</p>

<p>Human happiness would seem to be dependent
on three primary causes—the intellect, the affections,
and that which is physical. A certain portion of all,
with their accompanying misery, is unquestionably
the general lot, though so unequally distributed.
But, making the proper allowances for a common
nature, we are to distinguish between the consequences
of particular conditions of society. The
greatest obstacle to all our enjoyments is worldly
care, and as we increase what is deemed our civilisation,
we augment the cares by which they are
to be acquired or retained. There is, certainly, a
medium in this matter, as in every thing else, but
as few are disposed to respect it, it may be set
down as unattainable in practice. I believe more
people are unhappy because they cannot possess
certain indulgences, or because, when possessed,
they have been bought too dear, than because they
never knew them at all.</p>

<p>It has long struck me that the term “happy
country” is singularly misapplied, as regards America;
and, I believe, also as regards this country.
It is true, it has a conventional meaning, in which
sense it may be well enough; but, comparing the
people of France, or Italy, with those of England,
or the United States, all external symptoms must
be treacherous, or the former have greatly the advantage.
By placing incentives before us to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
exertions, the <ins class="corr" id="tn-214" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'El Derado'">
El Dorado</ins> of our wishes is never
obtained, and we pass our lives in vain struggles
to reach a goal that recedes as we advance. This,
you will be apt to say, is the old truism of the
moralist, and proves as much against one nation, as
against another. I think the latter position untrue.
Competition may be pushed so far as to neutralize
all its fruits, by inciting to envy and strife. In
America, for instance, all the local affections are
sacrificed to the spirit of gain. The man who
should defend the roof of his fathers, against an
inroad of speculators, would infallibly make enemies,
and meet with persecution. Thus is he
precluded from one source of happiness that is connected
with the affections; for, though the law
might protect him, opinion, which is stronger than
law, would sooner or later drive him from his
fireside. I know very well this is merely a consequence
of a society in the course of establishing
itself, but it shows how vulnerable is our happiness.</p>

<p>But, putting all theory out of the question, neither
the English nor the Americans have the air
and manners of a happy people, like the French
and the Italians. The first have a sullen, thoughtful
look, as if distrustful of the future, which gives
one the idea that their enjoyments are deferred to a
more favourable opportunity; while the two last
seem to live as time goes on. Something of this
is probably owing to temperament, but temperament
itself has, in part, a moral origin. As to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
Americans, there are very many reasons for their
want of happiness. The settlement of an immense
country snaps the family ties, though the constant
migration has the effect to produce an amalgamated
whole. The tendency of things generally, with
us, is to destroy all individuality of character and
feeling, and to concentrate every thing in the common
identity. One would be set down for an
aristocrat, who should presume to enjoy himself
independently of his neighbours. It is true, that
so far as gain is concerned, there is an exception,
the absence of restriction giving free exercise to
personal efforts; but when money is obtained by
individual enterprise, it must be used, in a greater
degree than common, in conformity with the feeling
of the nation. One disposed to cavil at the
institutions, might almost fancy the public had a
jealousy of a man’s possessing kinsmen that were
not thrown into the general stock. But this weakness
of the family tie, in America, is to be ascribed
to other causes, among which the constant migrations,
as I have just observed, have a conspicuous
place. Let the reason be what it will, the effect is
to cut us off from a large portion of the happiness
that is dependent on the affections.</p>

<p>Then the whole Anglo-Saxon race is deficient in
the enjoyments that are so much dependent on the
tastes. While there is even a vein of higher poetical
feeling than common among a few exceptions,
as if nature delighted in extremes, the mass have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
little relish for poetry, scarcely any good music, and
appear to be absolutely wanting in those sentiments
which throw so much grace around the rustic amusements
of other countries. One might account for
these peculiarities in the Americans, by their fanatical
origin, and peculiar physical condition, but they
are almost as true as respects England itself, as they
are with us. The Germans, and other northern nations,
the nearest to us in extraction, have a wild
poetry in their most vulgar superstitions that is not
found here. They cultivate music, and have a deep
feeling for it, as an art. This single fact is coupled
with one of the highest enjoyments with which we
are gifted. The music of America is beneath contempt.
We are probably worse off in this particular,
than any other civilized people, though certainly
improving. The English, though greatly
our superiors, are much behind all the other European
nations, with which I am acquainted. The
music of the people has a cast of vulgarity about it,
like our own, that of itself denotes a want of feeling
for the art. Even the French, by no means a people
of poetical tastes, are greatly their superiors in
music. One seldom hears a vulgar air even among
the <i lang="fr">bas peuple</i>. I make little doubt, that, in time,
we shall surpass the English in this art.</p>

<p>All these peculiarities diminish the enjoyments
of the English; but, it strikes me, that the principal
reason why these people and the Americans are
less happy than usual, is to be found in the fact that,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
by admitting civilization, men admit cares, whose
moral evils are not compensated for, until one reaches
a degree of cultivation far above the level of mediocrity.
There is, unquestionably, much physical
suffering, all over Europe, that is virtually unknown
with us, but the remarks just made are meant to
apply to those who are removed from the first wants
of life. Both England and America strike me as
being countries of facts rather than of feelings. It
is almost purely so, but the English have one great
advantage over us, in being a country of ideas, if not
of sentiments and affections. The difference is
owing to our youth.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Passons au deluge</i>:—Speaking of the music of
England, you are not to understand that there is no
good music here. The gold of the country attracts
the first artists of Europe, as a matter of course; but
even the cultivated English have, quite obviously,
not much more feeling for the art than we have ourselves.
As a greater portion travel, their tastes are
a little more cultivated than those of our people, but
nothing strikes one sooner, than the obvious difference
in feeling between an English audience, at the
opera, and one on the continent of Europe.</p>

<p>Still, the street music of London is positively the
best in the world. The improvement in the last
few years, even, is quite apparent. Respectable artists,
such as would gladly be received in our orchestras,
walk the streets, and play the music of
Rossini, Mozart, Beethoven, Meyerbeer, Weber,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
&amp;c. &amp;c. beneath your windows. London is not as
well arranged for this species of enjoyment as the
towns of the continent, for there are no courts in
which the performers can get away from the clamour
of the streets; but, about eight, the carriages
cease, every body being at dinner, and most of the
more private places are quite silent. Since the
weather has become mild, I have frequently paused
in my evening walks, to listen to airs that have
come from the harp, violin, and flageolet, and have
almost fancied myself in Venice, or Naples, though
surrounded by the dingy bricks of London. A party
of French have found us out, and they come regularly,
twice a week, and play old French airs beneath
the windows; favours that are seldom conferred
on private houses, the public hotels being their usual
stopping places. The secret of this unusual feature
in the town, is in the fact, that where an Italian, or
a Frenchman, though filled with enthusiasm, would
bestow a few sous, the Englishman, with immoveable
muscles, throws out half a crown. Walking to
a dinner, the other evening, I heard a grand piano,
on which some one was playing an overture of Rossini’s,
accompanied by a flageolet, and, going a little
out of my way to ascertain the cause, I found the
artist in the street, seated before the open windows
of a hotel. He trundled the machine about on a sort
of wheelbarrow, and his execution was quite equal
to what one usually hears in society.</p>

<p>I cannot describe to you the influence these sweet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
sounds, especially when they revive the recollections
of other and more genial lands, have over the
feelings. These are the moments in which men
may be said truly to live, and half an hour of such
delight is worth a year passed in listening to the
prices of lots, and to the variation of the markets.
Music is certainly a good <em>article</em>!</p>

<span class="fs70">TO JACOB SUTHERLAND, ESQ., GENEVA.</span></h2>


<p>Amid the affected disdain, that is so often assumed
by the press and orators of England, when there is
occasion to allude to America, a lively jealousy of
the growing power of the republic is easily discovered.
But, one at a distance, like yourself, may
not be aware of the extent to which this feeling is
allied with apprehension of Russia. The wise policy
of Alexander created affinities of an alarming nature
between the government of Russia and that of America,
and, mingled with a reluctance to give us fair
words and honest treatment, that goes nigh to choke
them, the statesmen, here, are beginning to feel the
necessity of counteracting some of the bad consequences
of their own former blunders.</p>

<p>Heaven bless the Quarterly Review, say I! Although
I am far from boasting of the mental independence
of the republic, for few men can be more
strongly impressed with the dangerous character of
the practice that so generally prevails at home, of
reasoning and feeling on all questions of polity like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
Englishmen, instead of Americans, I do believe the
Quarterly Review has done more towards alienating
the feelings of America from Great Britain, than the
two wars, the commercial rivalries, the orders in
council, impressment, the Henry plot, and all the
other points of national dissension, united. This
may sound extravagant, but I am not the only
person of this way of thinking; and it is certain;
the facts being too notorious to admit of dispute, that
several of our prominent men, who were formerly
most subject to the Anglo-mania, have beep converted
to a more healthful state of feeling, in consequence
of their having been, accidentally, personal
sharers in the abuse that has been so lavishly heaped
on the nation. I have laughed, heartily, at the
writhings of a certain instructor, under whom you and
I, when boys, were condemned to hear all things
English lauded to the skies, but who, having been
roughly handled, as a writer, in this very Quarterly,
has since come out manfully in vindication, as it is
called, of the country, or, in other words of its
<em>things</em>, and, in reality, of himself.</p>

<p>This is a species of independence of which their
will never be a lack. Let us, be grateful, however,
for this much, and thank our stars and the Quarterly,
accordingly. When I rejoice in the alienation of the
feelings of America from England, it is not that I
could wish to see our own nation on worse terms
with this, than with any other, but, under the full
conviction that we must pass through some such process<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
of alienation, before we shall ever get to consider
the English in the only mode that is either
safe or honourable for one independent people to
regard another. The constant infusion of new
prejudices and partialities, by the agency of emigrants,
and the manner in which we are obliged to
depend on England for our literature, has rendered
the change singularly slow, nor does it strike me
that what is actually going on, is taking the right
direction. We no longer believe that an English
apple is better than an American apple, it is true;
or even an English hog, or a horse; but, we do
not the less believe in English political principles,
although nothing can be more apparent than the
fact that these principles have been established as a
consequence of a factitious, and, in some measure, a
fortuitous condition of society, to which our own
system is, perhaps, more antagonist than that of
any other Christian state.</p>

<p>Keeping the question of our moral dependence
out of view, and returning to this country, I think
the jealousy of Russia is about to produce a change
of policy as respects America. It is quite impossible
for one never out of America, to appreciate the
nature and extent of the interest that all the higher
classes, here, feel in their foreign policy. In America,
we are almost in a state of nature, as regards
every thing of the sort, the world furnishing no
example perhaps of a people so much neglecting
all the great interests that are not placed immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
before their eyes.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Did the people of the
United States understand their true situation, the
intentions, expectations, and wishes of this part of
the world, they would at once exhibit a naval force,
that should demonstrate the hazards of incurring
their just resentment.</p>

<p>Some of our early diplomatists in Europe, when
men of talents and character were alone employed
in such situations, speak of the reasons they had for
distrusting the intentions of England, on the subject
of our independence, but I have lately been
astonished at hearing it suggested, here, that this
government has not yet absolutely abandoned the
project of attempting re-colonization. It is probable
that this opinion is now exaggerated, but that such
a scheme did exist, until within the last fifteen or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
twenty years, I make no doubt. There is a remarkable
expression in an article of the Edinburgh
Review, that appeared shortly after the peace of
1815. I quote from memory, but the words were
nearly these, and as to the idea it is accurate, the
subject of the article being America—“<em>We presume
that the project of re-colonization is at
length abandoned!</em>” Such a remark would not have
been made causelessly. But I have, myself, been
present when this subject was discussed, in Paris,
by men who are in the secrets of states, and I well
remember the surprise I felt at hearing the possibility
of re-colonization suggested. On that occasion,
when I gave the failure in 1776, as a proof of the impracticability
of such a project at this late day, I was
significantly reminded of the hundred millions that
England had subjugated in India.</p>

<p>One thing is certain; we estimate our own security,
very differently from what it is estimated here.
It is the expectation of Europe generally, and of
England especially, that we shall separate; and to
this end, it is probable that the efforts of those who
plot our overthrow will be directed. Little, I
might almost say nothing, is known in America, of
the means that are employed by the privileged
classes of Europe to maintain their ascendancy. We
have heard a great deal of the machinations of infidelity,
and of the infamous schemes of demagogues
to overturn the existing order of things, in these
governments, but scarcely a whisper has been breathed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
against the plots and inexcusable agencies that
are universally attributed to the friends of despotism
and aristocracy, by the friends of liberty. Little
accustomed to think for ourselves, and with a
corrupt and interested press, we have lent greedy
ears to <i lang="la">ex-parte</i> testimony, and, ready enough to
oppose the principles of the Age of Reason and of
the Illuminati, we have overlooked the essential
circumstance that they are merely the reaction of
extreme abuses, and that the root of the evil lies
deeper than the disgusting excesses which have
been so zealously paraded before our eyes. I can
know no more of the past than what I hear; but
the fairest minded men of France have assured me
of their deep conviction, that the machinations of
their enemies were principally instrumental in
bringing about the horrors of their own revolution.
No one pretends that it is unnatural for those who
have been ruthlessly depressed, to break out in acts
of violence when suddenly released, but they believe
that agents were employed to excite these
passions to fury, and that, finding it impossible to
stay the torrent of revolution by resistance, the
privileged here, directed their schemes to bringing
it into disrepute, by inciting the people to acts that
would be certain to offend humanity. One anecdote
related to me by General Lafayette, in person,
I consider so remarkable that it shall be repeated,
substituting, however, initials of names that do not
apply to those that were actually mentioned, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
some of the parties are still living. I select this
anecdote from a hundred, because I so well know
the integrity of the party from whom it is derived,
that I feel confident there is no exaggeration or
colouring in the account, and because it is, fortunately,
in my power to prove that I had it from
General Lafayette, almost in the words in which it
is given to you.</p>

<p>We were conversing on the subject of the probable
agency of the monarchs and aristocrats of Europe,
in bringing about the excesses of the revolution.
“Count N—— was in England during
the peace of Amiens,” said our venerable friend,
“and he dined with Lord G——, one of Mr.
Pitt’s cabinet. They were standing together at a
window of the drawing-room, when Lord G—— pointed
to a window of a house at a little distance,
and said “that is the window of the room in which
F—— lodged, when in England.” “F——,” exclaimed
Count N——, “what can you know, my
Lord, of such a man as F——!” The English
minister smiled significantly, and replied “why, <em>we
sent him to France</em>.”</p>

<p>By substituting for “Count N——” the name of
a Frenchman who has been a minister under nearly
every government in France for the last forty years,
and whose private and public character is one of
the best of that country; for that of Lord G——, a
well-known English statesman; and that of F——,
one of the greatest monsters to which the Reign of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
Terror gave birth, you will have the story almost
in the words in which it was related to me by
General Lafayette, who told me he had it from
Count N——, himself.</p>

<p>Had this anecdote appeared in one of the newspaper
comments of the day, I should think less of it,
but coming as it did, from a distinguished Frenchman,
and he of better reputation than most of the
politicians of the period, to a man like Lafayette,
who is so perfectly free from the vice of attributing
base motives to even his enemies, and this in a free
and friendly conversation, with no apparent reason
to misrepresent, I confess it has struck me as worthy
of more than ordinary consideration.</p>

<p>When we remember how natural it is to employ
the most obvious agencies in effecting our objects,
one is not to be surprised that the scheme of
pushing the popular feelings into extremes, should
suggest itself, on such an occasion; and, as for any
restraint imposed by principles, men are so apt to
shift a divided responsibility from their own shoulders
to those of their associates, so ready to look for
justification in the end, and always so much disposed,
in politics, to consider “<i lang="fr">une faute</i>” more heinous
than “<i lang="fr">un crime</i>,” that I have no difficulty in believing
the story, on the score of any moral scruples
in the parties. The avowal might cause surprise,
but it was two old soldiers talking over the different
<i lang="fr">ruses</i> of their late campaigns, and surprising things
of the sort leak out in this way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Huskisson was a student of medicine in Paris,
at the commencement of the French revolution.
The French openly accuse him of having worn the
<i lang="fr">bonnet rouge</i>, and of having belonged to the most
exaggerated of the Jacobins. They add that he was
suddenly lost sight of, and when next seen was in
the employment of the British government. All
this may be true, however, and still no more than a
natural consequence of youth and inexperience.
Had Mr. Huskisson been less equivocal in his commercial
ethics, and more consistent with his own
avowed principles, the circumstance would not have
much weight with me, for nothing is more natural
than for a young mind to be carried away by sentiments
that appear to be generous; but I hold it to be
a pretty safe rule that the man who is jesuitical on
any one fact, is to be distrusted on all others. That
Mr. Huskisson is self-contradicted and insincere in
his Free Trade doctrines, is as obvious as any moral
truth I know.</p>

<p>But, admitting that both these tales are idle, it
would be folly for an American to shut his eyes to
the confidence with which even the women, here,
speak of the dismemberment of the Union. This is
the point to which our enemies will be certain to
direct their machinations; and if we wish “to calculate
its value” to ourselves, we have only to regard
the importance that is attached to it, by our enemies.
You will judge of my surprise, when a young girl,
under twenty years, told me very cooly, in answer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
to some pleasantry that had passed between us, on
the subject of national power, “Oh, but your Union
will soon be dissolved!”</p>

<p>Mr. Cobbett, who, though any thing but authority
in matters of fact, is a shrewd thinker, and is accustomed
to appreciate the means and agencies of states,
has just declared in his journal, that, unless we abandon
the protective policy, England ought to manifest
her real power, and “blow their boasted Union to
the winds.” Here we have a specimen of the ethics
as well of the means employed, in such matters, by
politicians. Unless we abandon a legitimate policy
of our own, the social firebrand is to be lighted in
our bosom! This savours strongly of the principles
contained in the anecdote of General Lafayette. It
will be said, however, that Mr. Cobbett is authority
for nothing. But other journals have said, in substance,
the same thing, and, I think, such is the tone
of most political men, here. I have said that we
overrate our security. A people, as much in the
habit of looking to another nation for opinions, as
our own, cannot be otherwise <ins class="corr" id="tn-229" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'than dependant, to'">
than dependent, to</ins> a certain degree, on the mercy of those who give
them their impulses. No one can deny that we receive
from England a vast deal that is excellent and
useful, and it will be the cue of those who wish to
influence us to our own injury, to mix their poison
so artfully with this wholesome nutriment, that the
two shall be swallowed together. Coupled with the
most inflated boastings about American literature,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
in the journals, we may constantly see statements
that such and such a work is republished in England,
or has gone to a second edition in this country, as
the highest eulogium that can be given. Much
the greater proportion of our writers still manifest a
dependance on English opinion, a dread of its censure,
and a desire to secure its favour, in a way that cannot
easily be mistaken. God forbid! that any one
should indulge in the low calumnies that mark
equally ignorance and vulgarity; but it is painful to
see the truckling manner in which flattery and
homage are interwoven in so many of our works,
with a manifest design to secure the favour of a people,
who do not care to conceal their contempt. In
my own case, how often have I had occasion to see
the influence of this spirit, by having it tauntingly
thrown into my teeth that such and such abuse has
appeared in some English journal—perhaps such and
such a puff, by way of flattery! There is not an
American writer, at this moment, who does not
lie at the mercy of the English critics, should they
consider him of sufficient importance to notice; and
there are symptoms that this country begins to
think seriously, if indeed it has not long thought, of
influencing the reputation of our political men. That
such are their own opinions of their own power is
sufficiently manifest, for they openly boast of it in
the newspapers. Obvious attempts are made to
influence opinion even in France, a country that is
singularly deaf to foreign impressions; and if they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
can excite a comment in France, they can convulse
America.</p>

<p>In regarding this subject, the feelings and dispositions
of the English nation are to be kept out of
sight; for the human impulses of bodies of men are
of no account in the control of interests like these:
they who move the wires are behind the scenes, and
the mass here, like the mass at home, is wrought on
in a way that is perceptible only to the vigilant and
the observing. But it is a humiliating fact, accompanying
these circumstances, that the English see
their influence, and deride us for it, even while they
exercise it.</p>

<p>Some peculiarities of a physical nature serve
to aid foreigners in perpetuating their power over
the American mind. The population is so diffused,
that, unless in cases which excite local interest,
there is no opinion sufficiently strong to
cope with that which is formed in the towns,
and these towns, particularly those of the most
influence, are quite as much foreign as American.
A large portion of even the presses, in the seaports,
are directly controlled by men who were
born British subjects, and it is a peculiarity about
these people, scarcely ever to forget their origin.
There is an infatuation in America, on this subject,
that one who stands aloof, can hardly credit. Still,
when we come to look into all the causes, it can
scarcely create surprise that the writers of the nation,
look as much to foreign as to native approbation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
that the diplomatists court their enemies, instead
of their friends, and that public opinion is
constantly influenced by interests and rights adverse
to our own.</p>

<p>God knows, what is to be the final result. We
may grow out of this weakness, as children get the
better of the rickets; or we may succumb to the
disease, as <ins class="corr" id="tn-232" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'children often die'">
children often do</ins>. There is little use,
however, in treating it with an overstrained delicacy,
for it is the school of sentimentalists that
has aggravated the disease to its present dangerous
extent, and nothing will be so apt to cure it, besides
time, as a little caustic, properly applied. I very
well know, it is said, that the war of 1812,
liberated the American mind from its ancient thraldom,
and for a time it did; so did the war of the
revolution; but no sooner did things, in both instances,
revert back to their ancient channels, than
the habits of thought appear to have kept them
company. We have gained a little, permanently,
beyond a question. No one thinks now, that a
British frigate has only to say, “boh!” to an American
frigate, to cause her to strike her flag; but this
very point of manhood in the field, will prove the
tendency to drop back into the old train of thinking,
for, in despite of all the experience of 1776,
thousands and tens of thousands of native citizens,
believed we could not resist the English, when war
was declared in 1812, either ashore or afloat! I
do not mean, that they believed the power of America<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
could not resist the power of England, but
that the man of America could not fight the man of
England; for to this had the uninterrupted practice
of reading the English accounts of themselves,
brought the state of public opinion. As no nation
has shown a better spirit in the field, when actually
called on to serve, does not this fact prove how
completely courage is a matter of convention, and
how necessary it is to guard all the habits of
thought?</p>

<p>There is a feature of English jealousy, that strikes
me as particularly odd. Every one reasons here, as if
our government is always to be distrusted on account
of its tendency to be driven into wars, by the
truculent spirit of the democracy! I should say this
notion haunts the English imagination, on the subject
of America, though it would be difficult to give
a good reason for it. The war of 1812, probably
took our enemy by surprise, but it could not have
been because the people of America rushed into it
with precipitation, but because they had forborne
so long as to remove every apprehension of their
appealing to force at all. There is a professed distrust
of General Jackson on this account. They
think, or affect to think, that being a soldier, he
will profit by the elements of democracy, and bring
on a war of conquest, with a view to his own glory
and tastes. Some do not hesitate to say, that he
will then aim at a crown, like Napoleon!<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>It would be an occupation of interest, to note
the changes, moral and physical, that time, climate,
and different institutions, have produced between
the people of England, and those of America.</p>

<p>Physically, I do not think the change as great as
is usually imagined. Dress makes a sensible difference
in appearance, and I find that the Americans,
who have been under the hands of the English
tailors, are not easily distinguished from the English
themselves. The principal points of distinction
strike me to be these. We are taller, and less
fleshy; more disposed to stoop; have more prominent
features, and faces less full; are less ruddy,
and more tanned; have much smaller hands and
feet, anti-democratical as it may be; and are more
slouching in gait. The exceptions, of course, are
numerous, but I think these distinctions may be
deemed national. The American, who has become
Europeanized by dress, however, is so very different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
a looking animal, from what he is at home, that
too much stress is not to be laid on them. Then
the great extent of the United States is creating
certain physical differences in our own population,
that render all such comparisons liable to many qualifications.</p>

<p>As to stature, and physical force, I see no reason
to think the animal has deteriorated in America.
As between England and the old Atlantic states, the
difference is not striking, after one allows for the
disparity in numbers, and the density of the population
here, the eye always seeking exceptions; but,
I incline to believe that the southwest will turn
the scale to our side. I believe it to be a fact, that
the aborigines of that portion of the Union, were
larger than those of our own section of the country.</p>

<p>There are obvious physical differences among the
English themselves. One county is said to have
an undue proportion of red heads, another to have
men taller than common, this again men that are
shorter, and all to show traces of their remote origins.
It is probable, that some of these peculiarities
have descended to ourselves, though they have
become blended by the unusual admixture of the
population.</p>

<p>Morally, we live under the influence of systems
so completely the converse of each other, that it is
matter of surprise, so many points of resemblance
still remain. The immediate tendency of the English
system is, to create an extreme deference in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
all the subordinate classes for their superiors, while
that of the American is to run into the opposite
feeling. The effects of both these tendencies, are
certainly observable, though relatively, that of our
own much less, I think, than that of England. It
gives good models a rather better chance here, than
they have with us.</p>

<p>In England, the disaffected to the government,
are among precisely those who most sustain government
in America; and the disaffected in America,
(if so strong a word can properly be used, as applied
to natives,) are of a class whose interests it is to
sustain government in England.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> These facts give
very different aspects to the general features of society.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
Walking <ins class="corr" id="tn-239" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'in Regent street'">
in Regent’s street</ins>, lately, I witnessed
an attempt of the police, to compel some hackney
coachmen to quit their boxes, and go with them
before the magistrate. A crowd of a thousand people
collected immediately, and its feeling was decidedly
against the ministers of the law; so much
so, indeed, as to render it doubtful, whether the
coachmen, whose conduct had been flagrantly criminal,
would not be rescued. Now, in America, I
think, the feeling of such a crowd, would have been
just the other way. It would have taken an interest
in supporting the authorities of the country, instead
of an interest in opposing them. This was not the
case of a mob, you will remember, in which passion
puts down reason, but an ordinary occurrence
of the exercise of the power of the police. Instances
of this nature, might be multiplied, to show
that the mass of the two people, act under the influence
of feelings diametrically opposed to each
other.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Englishmen of the higher
classes are, with very few exceptions, and these
exceptions are usually instances of mere party opposition,
attached to their system, sensitive on the
subject of its merits or defects, and ever ready to
defend it when assailed. The American of the
same class is accustomed to sneer at democracy, to
cavil at its fruits, and to colour and exaggerate its
faults. Though this latter disposition may be, to a
degree, accounted for by the facts, that all merit is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
comparative, and most of our people have not had
the opportunities to compare; and that it is natural
to resist most that which most annoys, although the
substitution of any other for the actual system
would produce even greater discontent; still, I
think, the general tendency of aristocratical institutions
on the one hand, and of democratical on the
other, is to produce this broad difference in feeling,
as between classes.</p>

<p>Both the Americans and the English are charged
with being offensively boastful and arrogant, as nations,
and too much disposed to compare themselves
advantageously with their neighbours. I have visited
no country in which a similar disposition does
not exist, and as communities are merely aggregations
of men, I fancy that the disposition of a
people to take this view of their own merits, is no
more than carrying out the well-known principle
of individual vanity. The English and ourselves,
however, well may, and probably do differ from
other nations, in one circumstance connected with
such a failing. The mass in both nations, are better
instructed, and are of more account than the mass in
other countries, and their sentiments form more of
a public opinion than elsewhere. When the bulk
of a people are in a condition to make themselves
heard, one is not to expect much refinement or delicacy,
in the sentiments they utter. The English do
not strike me as being a vainer nation than the
French, although, in the way of ordinary intercourse,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
I believe that both they and we are more
boastful.</p>

<p>The English are to be particularly distinguished
from the Americans, in the circumstance of their being
proud people. This is a useful and even an ennobling
quality, when it is sustained by facts, though
apt to render a people both uncomfortable and
unpleasant, when the glory on which they pique
themselves is passed away. We are almost entirely
wanting in national pride, though abundantly supplied
with an irritable vanity, that might rise to pride,
had we greater confidence in our facts. Most
intelligent Englishmen are ready enough to admit
the obvious faults of their climate, and even of
their social condition, but it is an uncommon American
that will concede any thing material, on such
points, unless it can be made to bear on democracy.
We have the sensitiveness of provincials,
increased by the consciousness of having our spurs
to earn, on all matters of glory and renown, and
our jealousy extends even to the reputations of the
cats and dogs. It is but an indifferent compliment
to human nature to add, that the man who will
join, complacently, and I may say ignorantly, in the
abuse of foreigners against the institutions of the
country, and even against its people, always reserving
a saving clause in favour of his own particular
class, will take fire if an innuendo is hazarded
against its beef, or a suggestion made that the four
thousand feet of the Round Peak, are not equal to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
the thirteen thousand of the <i lang="de">Jung Frau</i>. The
English are tolerably free from this weakness, and
travelling is daily increasing this species of liberality,
at least. I presume that the insular situation
of England, and our own distance from Europe,
are equally the causes of these traits, though there
may be said to be a “property qualification” in the
very nature of man, that disposes him to view his
own things with complacency, and those of his
neighbours with distrust. Bishop Heber, in one of
his letters to Lord Grenville, in speaking of the
highest peaks <ins class="corr" id="tn-242" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'of the Himilayas'">
of the Himalayas</ins>, throws into a
parenthesis, “which I feel some exultation in saying,
is completely within the limits of the British
empire,” a sort of sentiment, of which, I dare say,
neither St. Chrysostom nor Polycarp was entirely
free.</p>

<p>On the subject of sensibility to comments on
their national habits and national characters, neither
France nor England is by any means as philosophical
or indifferent as one might suppose. As a
rule, I believe all men are more easily enraged
when their real faults are censured, than when their
virtues are called in question; and, if the defect
happen to be unavoidable, or one for which they
are not fairly responsible, the resentment is twofold
that which would attend a comment on a vice.
The only difference I can discover between the
English and ourselves, in this particular, is easily
to be traced to our greater provincialism, youth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
and the consciousness that we are obliged to anticipate
some of our renown. I should say that the
English are <em>thin-skinned</em>, and the Americans <em>raw</em>.
Both resent fair, frank, and manly comments with
the same bad taste, resorting to calumny, blackguardism,
and abuse, when wit and pleasantry
would prove both more effective and wiser, and,
perhaps, reformation, wisest of all. I can only
account for this peculiarity, by supposing that the
institutions and political facts of the two countries
have rendered vulgar-minded men of more account,
than is usually the case, and that their influence has
created a species of public opinion which is less
under the correction of taste, principles, and manners,
than is the case in nations where the mass is
more depressed. Of the fact, itself, there can be no
question.</p>

<p>In order to appreciate the effect of refinement on
this nation, it will be necessary to recur to some
of its statistical facts. England, including Wales,
contains rather less than fifty-eight thousand square
miles of territory; the state of New York, about
forty-three thousand. On the former surface, there
is a population of something like fifteen millions;
on the latter, a population of less than two. One
gives a proportion of about two hundred and sixty
to the square mile, and the other a proportion of
less than fifty. These premises, alone, would
show us the immense advantage that any given
portion of surface in England, must possess over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
the same extent of surface in America, in all those
arts and improvements, that depend on physical
force. If there were ten men of education, and
refinement, and fortune, in a county of New York,
of one thousand square miles in extent, there ought
to be more than fifty men of the same character
and means, in an English county of equal territory.
This is supposing that the real premises offer
nothing more against us, than the disproportion
between numbers and surface; whereas, in fact,
time, wealth, and an older civilization, more than
quadruple the odds. Even these do not make up
the sum of the adverse elements. Though England
has but fifteen millions of souls, the empire
she controls has nearly ten times that population,
and a very undue proportion of the results of so
great a physical force, centre in this small spot.</p>

<p>The consideration of these truths suggest several
useful heads of reflection. In the first place, they
show us, if not the absolute impossibility, the great
improbability, that the civilization, refinement,
knowledge, wealth, and tastes of even the best portions
of America, can equal those of this country, and
suggest the expediency of looking to either points
for our sources of pride. I have said, that the two
countries act under the influence of moral agencies
that are almost the converse of each other. The
condensation of improvement and cultivation is so
great here, that even the base of society is affected
by it, even to deportment; whereas, with us, these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
properties are so dispersed, as to render it difficult
for those who are lucky enough to possess them, to
keep what they have got, in face of the overshadowing
influence of a lower school, instead of
being able to impart them to society. Our standard,
in nearly all things, as it is popular, is
necessarily one of mediocrity; a highly respectable,
and, circumstances considered, a singularly creditable
one, but still a mediocrity; whereas; the condition
of these people has enabled them to raise a
standard, which, however much it may be and is
wanting in the better elements of a pure taste, has
immensely the advantage of our own, in most of
the obvious blandishments of life. More than half of
the peculiarities of America, peculiarities for which
it is usual to seek a cause in the institutions, simply
because they are so peculiar themselves, are to be
traced to facts like these; or, in other words, to the
disproportion between surface and numbers, the
want of any other than commercial towns, and our
distance from the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Every condition of society has its own advantages,
and its own disadvantages. To claim perfection
for any one, in particular, would be to deny
the nature of man. Their comparative merits are
to be decided, only, by the comparative gross
results, and it is in this sense, that I contend for the
superiority of our own. The utilitarian school, as it
has been popularly construed, is not to my taste,
either, for I believe there is great utility in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
grace and elegance of life, and no one would feel
more disposed to resist a system, in which these
essential properties are proscribed. That we are
wanting in both, I am ready to allow; but I think
the reason is to be found in facts entirely independent
of the institutions, and that the time will come,
when the civilization of America will look down
that of any other section of the world, if the
country can pass that state of probation, during
which it is and will be exposed to the assaults of
secret combinations to destroy it; and during
which, moreover, it is, in an especial degree, liable
to be affected by inherited opinions, and opinions
that have been obtained under a system that has so
many of the forms, while it has so few of the principles
of our own, as easily to be confounded with
it, by the ignorant and the unreflecting.</p>

<p>We over-estimate the effects of intelligence, as
between ourselves and the English. The mass of
information, here, probably exceeds that of America,
though it is less equally distributed. In <em>general</em>
knowledge of a practical nature, too, I think no
people can compete with our own. But there is a
species of information, that is both useful and refining,
in which there are few European nations that
do not surpass us. I allude, in particular, to most
things that serve to embellish life. In addition to
this superiority, the Europeans of the better classes
very obviously possess over us an important advantage,
in their intimate associations with each other,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
by which means they insensibly imbibe a great deal
of current knowledge, of which the similar classes
in America are nearly ignorant; or, which, if known
at all, is only known through the medium of books.
In the exhibition of this knowledge, which embraces
all that belongs to what is commonly termed a knowledge
of the world, the difference between the European
and the American is the difference to be seen
between the man who has passed all his days in good
society, and the man who has got his knowledge of it
from novels and plays.</p>

<p>In a correct estimate of their government, and
in an acquaintance with its general action, the English
are much our superiors, though we know most
of details. This arises from the circumstances that
the rights of an Englishman are little more than
franchises, which require no very profound examination
to be understood, while those of the American
depend on principles that demand study, and which
are constantly exposed to the antagonist influence
of opinions that have been formed under another
system. It is true the English monarchy, as a monarchy
and as it now exists, is a pure mystification,
but the supremacy of parliament being admitted,
there can arise no great difficulty on the score of interpretation.
The American system, moreover, is
complicated and double, and the only true Whig
and Tory parties that can exist must have their origin
in this circumstance. To these reasons may
be added the general fact, that the educated Englishman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
reasons on his institutions like an Englishman
only, while his American counterpart oftener
reasons on the institutions of the republic like an
Englishman too, than like an American. A single
fact will show you what I mean, although a hundred
might be quoted. In England the government is
composed, in theory, of three bases and one summit;
in America, it is composed of one base and three
summits. In one, there is supposed to be a balance
in the powers of the state; and as this is impossible in
practice, it has resulted in a consolidated authority
in its action; in the other, there is but one power,
that of the entire people, and the balance is in the
action of their agents. A very little reflection will
show that the maxims of two such systems ought to
be as different as the systems themselves.</p>

<p>The English are to be distinguished from the Americans,
by greater independence of personal habits.
Not only the institutions, but the physical condition
of our own country has a tendency to reduce us all
to the same level of usages. The steam-boats, the
over-grown taverns, the speculative character of the
enterprises, and the consequent disposition to do all
things in common, aid the tendency of the system
in bringing about such a result. In England a man
dines by himself, in a room filled with other hermits;
he eats at his leisure; drinks his wine in
silence; reads the paper by the hour, and, in all
things, encourages his individuality and insists on
his particular humours. The American is compelled
to submit to a common rule; he eats when others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
eats; sleeps when others sleep; and he is lucky, indeed,
if he can read a paper in a tavern without having
a stranger looking over each shoulder.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The
Englishman would stare at a proposal that should invade
his habits under the pretence of a common wish,
while the American would be very apt to yield tacitly,
though this common wish should be no more
than an impudent assertion of some one who had
contrived to affect his own purposes, under the popular
plea. The Englishman is so much attached
to his independence that he instinctively resists
every effort to invade it, and nothing would be more
likely to arouse him than to say the mass thinks differently
from himself; whereas the American ever
seems ready to resign his own opinion to that which
is made to seem to be the opinion of the public. I
say <em>seems</em> to be, for so manifest is the power of
public opinion, that one of the commonest expedients
of all American managers, is to create an impression
that the public thinks in a particular way, in order
to bring the common mind in subjection. One
often renders himself ridiculous by a foolish obstinacy,
and the other is as often contemptible by
a weak compliance. A portion of what may be
called the <em>community</em> of character and habits in
America, is doubtless owing to the rustic nature of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
society, for one more easily maintains his independence
in a capital than in a village, but I think the
chief reasons are to be found in the practice of referring
every thing to the common mind.</p>

<p>It is usual to ascribe the solitary and unsocial habits
of English life, to the natural dispositions of the
people, but I think unjustly. The climate is made
to bear the blame of no small portion of this peculiarity.
Climate, probably, has an influence on
us all, for we know that we are more elastic, and
more ready to be pleased in a clear bracing air, than
in one that is close and <em>sciroccoish</em>, but, on the whole
I am led to think, the English owe their habits to
their institutions, more than to any natural causes.</p>

<p>I know no subject, no feeling, nothing, on
which an Englishman, as a rule, so completely
loses sight of all the better points of his character,
on which he is so uniformly bigotted and unjust,
so ready to listen to misrepresentation and caricature,
and so unwilling to receive truth, on which,
in short, he is so little like himself in general, as
on those connected with America.</p>

<p>As the result of this hasty and imperfect comparison,
I am led to believe, that a national character
somewhere between the two, would be preferable
to either, as it is actually found. This may be saying
no more than that man does not exist in a condition
of perfection; but were the inequalities named,
pared off from both people, an ingenious critic
might still find faults of sufficient magnitude, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
preserve the identity with the human race, and
qualities of sufficient elevation, to entitle both to be
considered among the greatest and best nations of
modern, if not of any other, times.</p>

<p>In most things that pertain to taste, the English
have greatly the advantage of us, though <em>taste</em> is
certainly not the strong side of English character.
On this point, alone, one might write a book, but a
very few remarks must now satisfy you. In nothing,
however, is this superiority more apparent,
than in their simplicity, and, particularly, in their
simplicity of language. They call a spade, a spade.
I very well know, that neither men nor women, in
America, who are properly educated, and who are
accustomed to its really better tone, differ much, if
any, from the English in this particular, but, in this
case, as in most others, in which <em>national</em> peculiarities
are sought, the better tone of America is
overshadowed by its mediocrity.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Although I deem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
the government of this country the very quintessence
of hocus pocus, having scarcely a single practice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
that does not violate its theory, I believe that
there is more honesty of public sentiment in England,
than in America. The defect at <ins class="corr" id="tn-253" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'home, I asscribe'">
home, I ascribe</ins>, in common with the majority of our national
failings, to the greater activity, and greater <em>unresisted</em>
force of ignorance and cupidity, there, than
here. High qualities are nowhere collected in a
sufficient phalanx to present a front to the enemy,
in America.</p>

<p>The besetting, the degrading vice of America, is
the moral cowardice by which men are led to truckle
to what is called public opinion; though this opinion
is as inconstant as the winds, though, in all cases,
that enlist the feelings of factions there are <em>two</em>, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
sometimes twenty, each differing from all the others,
and though, nine times in ten, these opinions are
mere engines set in motion by the most corrupt and
the least respectable portion of the community,
for unworthy purposes. The English are a
more respectable and constant nation than the
Americans, as relates to this peculiarity; probably,
because the condensed masses of intelligence and
character enable the superior portion of the community
to produce a greater impression on the inferior,
by their collective force. In standing prejudices,
they strike me as being worse than ourselves;
but in passing impressions greatly our superiors.</p>

<p>For the last I have endeavoured to account, and I
think the first may be ascribed to a system that is
sustained by errors that it is not the interest of the
more enlightened to remove, but which, instead of
weakening in the ignorant, they rather encourage in
themselves.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="LETTER_XXIX">LETTER XXIX.<br>
<span class="fs70">TO CAPTAIN B. COOPER, U. S. NAVY.</span></h2>


<p>Having a long-standing engagement to be in
Amsterdam, early in June, we have been compelled
to quit London, before the termination of the season.
I could have wished to remain longer, but
the force of things has moved heavier bodies.</p>

<p>Quitting England is, by no means, as easy a matter
for a foreigner, as quitting almost any other
European state. I was obliged to go first to the
alien office, which is near Westminster Hall, and
then proceed to the custom-house, a distance of
several miles, in order to get the required permission.
If all these forms are necessary, (and I shall
not take it on myself to say they are not) it would
save trouble could every thing be done in the same
office, or, at least, in the same building.</p>

<p>My labours in obtaining the permit to embark,
and in taking a passage, have taught me a secret in
relation to the advantage we possess over the English
in sailing ships. The excess of men causes all
occupations to be crowded, and as each <i lang="fr">employé</i>
must have a livelihood out of his employment, he
becomes a charge on the business. If an Englishman
could live on a bit of garlic and a few chesnuts,
this would not be of so much moment; but
he is a beef-eating and a beer-drinking animal, and
likes to be neat in his attire, and the trade is compelled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
to pay a pretty good price for his support.
Thus when I went on board the steamboat to take
the necessary passage, I was compelled to return to
the shore, and walk, at least, half a mile to an office
to effect my purpose. The person to whom I was
referred, received me civilly, but after making his
bow, he put his hands in his pockets, and ordered
two or three clerks to receive my money, enter
my name, and do the other necessary things. In
America the captain would do all this himself,
and would find no time to put his hands in his
breeches pockets.</p>

<p>You can form no notion, of the intrigues and
frauds that are practised, in these old countries, in
the struggles for a subsistence. Few people of any
condition have much direct communication with
their tradesmen, and the buying, as a matter of
course, falls into the hands of servants. A certain
per centum is given the buyer, which the seller
adds to the price. This is another reason why the
servant is a personage of more importance in Europe
than with us, for his master’s custom usually
depends on <em>his</em> patronage. A case of this sort has
occurred under my own immediate observation.
The proprietor of one of the most celebrated vineyards
of France, certain that a vast deal of spurious
wine was sold under the name of his vintages, determined
to make an effort to bring the pure liquor
into proper notice, a difficult achievement, by the
way, as the palate once set to even a vicious taste,
is as little likely to relish perfection, as any thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
else. My acquaintance determined to get his wine
introduced to the table of the king, at once, as a
certain means of making it known. I dare say,
now, you will think he had nothing to do, but to
request some purveyor to consent to let the liquor
be put before his majesty, and to await the issue.
So far from taking this simple course, however, he
was advised to make interest with a lady of rank,
in order to induce her to persuade a connexion of
her own, who was one of the most distinguished
men of the age, and had great favour with the king,
to present the latter with a case of the wine, and
this, too, in a way that might insure its reaching
the royal mouth. I cannot say whether the experiment
failed or succeeded, but I believe it failed,
and most probably through the intrigues of those
interested.</p>

<p>In America we have not yet reached this pass,
although a glorious beginning has commenced in
the commercial towns, which, in their way, are probably
as corrupt as any in the world. I have seen
abundant proof of a disposition in the trading part
of our community, abroad, to combine and conspire
to attain their ends, without regard to truth, principles,
or justice, and I presume we are to go the
way of all flesh in this, as in other respects.</p>

<p>I have not mentioned the subject, because I believe
England more obnoxious to this charge of
management than other European countries, for
probably there is less of it here
<ins class="corr" id="tn-257" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'than elesewhere'">
than elsewhere</ins>; certainly much less than in France; but it naturally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
suggested itself when I came to speak of the
number of subordinates that are employed in all
matters of business.</p>

<p>Our little preparations were soon made, and, on
the appointed day, we went on board the vessel,
which was lying off the custom-house. As we all
stood on deck, just as the boat was about to proceed,
the master came round to ask the foreigners for
their permits to quit the country. “You have no
need of one,” he observed to me, in passing. “I
have one, notwithstanding.” The man stared, and
asked an explanation with his eyes. I told him I
was a foreigner; an American. “I have been in
America,” he said, “but we hardly look on your
countrymen as foreigners.” There was more of
the feeling which prevails in America towards
England in these words and in this man’s manner,
than I had ever before witnessed in England. He
proved to be a mild decent man, and well disposed
to introduce some of our improvements into his
boat.</p>

<p>We had a party of cocknies on board, who went
as far as Gravesend for the fun of the thing. Great
hilarity prevailed under the excitement of the usual
condiments of bread, cheese and porter, and we
were not sorry to be quit of them.</p>

<p>The weather was fine, and the North Sea as
smooth as a dish. The whole night were we paddling
through it, and the next morning I looked
out, in vain, for any signs of land. Our boat was
a solid, good vessel, but slow of foot. The construction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
necessary to weathering a heavy sea, may
cause these boats to make less way than our own
steamers, though those which go round Point Judith
and through the Sound have also need of some
of the same qualities. As between them, I think
the American boats usually go three feet to the
English’s two.</p>

<p>At length a low spit of sand hove in sight ahead,
with here and there a tree or a church tower, that
appeared to rise out of the water. This was Holland,
a country, that, in the language of seamen,
may be said to be awash. As we drew in nearer
with the land, the villages and towers were actually
made as one makes the upper sails of a ship before
the hull. When fairly between the islands, by
going up a few rattlins in the rigging, I got a glimpse
of meadows that lay beneath the level of tide, from
whose inroads they were protected by embankments.
The whole country reminded me of a ship
with its dead lights in.</p>

<p>I saw a wagon rattling along a causeway, and it
was a <em>fac simile</em> of the wagons that go under the
name of Dutch wagons in New York, even to the
curvature of the side boards. The only difference
I could perceive was in the fact that this had no
tongue! The country is so level, that holding
back is unnecessary, and a short crooked tiller, that
is worked by the foot of the teamster answers the
purpose of guiding the vehicle. This was Dutch
economy, with a vengeance, for the difference in
cost could not exceed a guilder, and the difference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
in security, time and comfort, must be worth twenty.
You will easily understand, that when it becomes
necessary to stop one of these crafts, sail
must be shortened in season, or the momentum
would send the whole on the heels of the horses.</p>

<p>Presently, we got a sight of the steeples of
Rotterdam, which were well relieved by trees. The
verdure was oppressive, for the landscape resembled
one seen through a bit of green glass. The
boat was soon along side of the Boom Key, and we
were all marched off in a body to have our trunks
examined. Mine were merely opened and closed
again. The passport was glanced at, and we were
dismissed to a hotel. Before we entered the latter
I had time to look about me, and to see a hundred
things that recalled Albany and New York as they
appeared in their palmy Dutch condition.</p>

<p>Here, then, we take our leave of England for a
time;—England, a country that I could fain like,
but whose prejudices and national antipathies throw
a chill over all my affections; a country that unquestionably
stands at the head of civilization in a
thousand things, but which singularly exemplifies
a truth that we all acknowledge, or how
much easier it is to possess great and useful, and
even noble qualities, than it is to display those that
are attractive and winning—a country that all respect,
but few love.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> In the reign of Queen Anne, out of a little more than
twenty dukes in the empire, six were descended in the direct
male line from the natural sons of King Charles II, viz.:
the Dukes of Richmond, Grafton, Cleveland, Northumberland,
St. Albans, and Buccleugh. The dukedoms of Northumberland
and Cleveland, are extinct, though the titles have
been revived in other families; but those of Richmond, St.
Albans, Grafton, and Buccleugh, are still enjoyed by the
descendants of Charles. George I., did not hesitate to ennoble
his mistress, whom he made Duchess of Kendal, and
George II., had also his Countess of Yarmouth. These two
women were made peeresses, because they were the king’s
mistresses, but no natural child was ennobled. George III.
was still more guarded in his amours, and although he is
said to have had several natural children, they were not publicly
recognised. The same is true with George IV., though
his manner of life was less guarded. The power of the aristocracy
had now become so great, that it repudiated such
admissions into their ranks. A struggle, however, occurred
in 1831, between the different castes of the state, and
the king rose in importance. In order to conciliate him, the
whigs immediately gave a peerage to the eldest of his natural
children by Mrs. Jordan, and ennobled all the others!</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> Proofs of <i lang="fr">naïveté</i> and ignorance of the world, are afforded
by most of our travellers, who are the dupes of their own
national conceit, and the more exaggerated forms of Europe.
As a people, I believe, we are in favour in no part of Europe.
I could give much proof on this point, and a good deal will
be incidentally introduced into these letters, but a single
anecdote must suffice here. There is one man who is much
visited and flattered by Americans, now living in England,
and divers interesting accounts of his kindness and philanthropy
are published by our tourists annually. Within a
month, conversing with a countryman just returned from a
long visit in Europe, he tells me that an acquaintance of his
visited this person, while he remained at an inn, where he
dined with a near relation of the great man. In the course
of conversation, my acquaintance expressed his apprehension
that the visit of —— would annoy ——. “Not at all,”
said the other, who believed his companion to be an Englishman,
“my —— rather likes ——, <em>for an American</em>.”
There are two things that every American should understand.
In associating with the English, if he betray the
least of the toad-eater, he is despised for the meanness; this
is human nature; if he manifest self-respect, and a determination
to have all the rights of a gentleman, he is hated for
presuming to be an Englishman’s equal.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> It is not yet ten years, since this opinion was given.
Were the money that the United States this year distributes
among the several states, as returned revenue, (near 8,000,000
sterling,) appropriated to a navy, it would <em>build</em> and keep at
sea for a twelvemonth, fifty sail of the line. It is “too bad”
that a nation, with such means, should be so much under
the dominion of a false feeling, as to allow another people
to occupy an island like Bermuda, at its threshold, with no
other view than to its own annoyance. The internal legislation
of this country is practically among the best in the
world, while its foreign interests seem to be conducted pretty
much on the Mahometan doctrine of fatalism.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> The German Prince speaks of giving the <em>arm</em> instead of
the <em>hand</em>, as an English usage. The writer passed five winters
in Paris, and never saw any thing but the arm given.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> I am quite aware that it will be affirmed by some of our
<i lang="fr">doctrinaires</i>, the king of England <em>does</em> exercise the prerogatives
of his office. It would be easy to produce proof enough to
the contrary, but take a single case. It is notorious that he
wishes a tory ministry, at this very moment, and it is equally
notorious that he cannot appoint one, on account of parliament.
Now his right to name his ministers is almost the only
undisputed prerogative, that is left him in theory even, for a
minister is made responsible for all the other executive acts.
But hear what a witness, whose loyalty will not be questioned
says. “It has affected me very much to hear of <em>our
king’s being constrained to part with all his confidential friends,
and his own personal servants</em> in the late general sweep. <em>Out
of a hundred stories</em>, I will only tell you one, which concerns
your old acquaintance Lord Bateman; he went to the king,
as usual, over night, to ask if his majesty would please to
hunt the next day: yes, my lord! replied the king, but I
find, <em>with great grief</em>, that I am not to have the satisfaction
of your company! This was the first intimation he had had
of the loss of his place; and I really think the contest with
France and America might have been settled, <em>though the
buck hounds had retained their old master</em>.” See, letter of
Hannah Moore to her sister, London, 1782. The Plantagenets
were not treated in this fashion, and yet England was
said to be governed, even in their day, by King, Lords, and
Commons!</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> One of the most ludicrous instances I know of the
manner in which terms are abused, in America, was related
to me lately, by Judge ——, of Louisiana. A constable
came into court, leading two knaves, and addressed him, by
saying—“Please your Honour, these are the two <em>gentlemen</em>,
who stole Col. D——’s horses.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> That the reader may understand the nature and extent
of the prejudices that are inculcated in England, against
this country, I extract a sentence from a <em>school</em> book, of a
good deal of reputation, <em>written by a clergyman</em>. The edition
is of 1830. “The women every where possess, in the
highest degree, the domestic virtues; they have more sweetness,
more goodness, <em>perhaps as much courage</em>, and more
sensibility and liberality, than the men.” Prejudice must
have taken deep root, indeed, in England, where the bad
taste of a sneer on the courage of America, was not self-evident.
One of the best informed men I met in that country,
told me, that no event, in his time, had produced so
deep a sensation in England, as the unexpected and bloody
resistance of the <em>armed population</em> to the British troops, at
Bunker Hill. One of the principal causes of the errors of
all Europe, as respects us, is owing to the tact, that their
writers, anxious to attract, deal with exceptions instead of
with the rules. The whole article of “America,” in the
book I have just quoted, betrays this fault. Among other
absurdities, it says, “there are scarcely in the country,
twenty native Americans, (meaning whites, of course,) in
the state of domestic servants.” There are, beyond question,
tens of thousands, including both sexes, and all ages.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> While this work is going through the press, Tucker’s
Jefferson has appeared. In allusion to the principles of a
memorial written by himself, Mr. Jefferson’s language is
quoted to the following effect. “The leap I then proposed
was too long, as yet, for the mass of our citizens.” Nearly
seventy years have since passed by; we have become a nation;
numerically and physically a <em>great</em> nation; and yet in how
many things that affect the supremacy of English opinion
and English theories, is “the leap” still “too long” for the
“mass of our citizens!” “It is these long leaps,” notwithstanding,
that make the difference between men.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> The intelligence of the death of this gentleman has
reached America, while this book is printing. John Loudon
McAdam was a native of Scotland, of the proscribed family
of McGregor. He was in the line of descent to a small
estate called Waterhead; but being cut off from his natural
claims, by the act of attainder, he came early to America,
as the adopted son and successor of an uncle, who had married
and established himself in New York. Here he
received his education, and continued seventeen years, or
down to the period of the peace of 1783. Returning to
Great Britain, he established himself at Bristol, near which
town he commenced his experiments in roads, more as an
amateur, than with any serious views of devoting himself to
the occupation. Meeting with unlooked for success, he
gradually extended his operations, until he finally transformed
most of the highways of the island, into the best of
the known world. For the last five-and-twenty years, his
whole time, and all his studies were directed to this one end.</p>

<p>Mr. McAdam was twice offered knighthood, and once a
baronetcy; distinctions that he declined. His second son,
however, has recently received the former honour, and is the
present Sir James McAdam. As this gentleman is much
employed about London, he is usually mistaken for the
father.</p>

<p>Mr. McAdam was twice married. His first wife was a
daughter of William Nicoll, proprietor of the great manor
of Islip, Suffolk county, Long Island, the collateral representative
of Col. Nicoll, who took the colony from the
Dutch, in 1663, and its first English governor; his second
wife was the eldest daughter of John Peter De Lancey, of
Mamaroneck, West Chester, New York.</p>

<p>Mr. McAdam was a man of a singularly calm and contemplative
mind, mingled with an unusual degree of practical
energy and skill. Quiet, modest, intelligent, and upright,
few men were more esteemed in private life; and while few
men have conferred more actual benefit on Great Britain,
scarcely any man has been less rewarded. Conscientious and
proud, he was superior to accepting favours that were beneath
his claims, or to soliciting those which were his due.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> A proof of this truth, is to be found in the law emancipating
the slaves of the islands, a step which is the certain
forerunner of their loss. It is well known to all near observers,
that this measure was dictated to parliament by the
sympathies of a public, to which momentary causes had given
an influence it never before possessed. Mr. Cobbett, however,
openly affirmed it was owing to a wish to convulse
America, by re-acting on public opinion here! One is not
obliged to believe all that <ins class="corr" id="fn-14" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Mr. Cobbet said'">
Mr. Cobbett said</ins>, but such a surmise,
even, proves something.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> Captain Hall says, that the houses of America struck him
as being only half furnished. On the other hand, the Duke
Bernard, of Saxe Weimar, who landed in Boston, coming
from England, says that he thought the houses appeared
better furnished than those he had just left in Great Britain.
On this testimony, the Quarterly joins issue, insinuating that
no one can hesitate to believe that a <em>captain in his majesty’s
navy</em> is a better judge in these matters than a mere <em>German</em>
Duke! The exquisite twaddle of such reasoning exposes
itself, and yet, in his main fact, Captain Hall is unquestionably
right. So far as we go, our furniture is generally handsomer
than that of England, and Duke Bernard has possibly
formed his opinion from particular houses, but nothing is
truer than that the American houses appear naked to one
coming from either France or England.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> Quite lately, the writer got into a rail-road car at Bordenton,
at a place where the company have since erected a
large warehouse or shed; some one, observing the signs of a
building around the car, inquired what they meant. The
writer, who sat by a window, was about to say, “They have
laid the foundations of a large house here,” when a fellow-traveller,
who occupied the other window, anticipated him,
by saying that, “Judging by external symptoms, they have
commenced the construction of an edifice of considerable
magnitude, calculated, most likely, to facilitate the objects
of the rail-road company.” One would not wish to lose the
cause of this disposition to the grandiose, but it is to be regretted
that sublimity is getting to be so common.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> One may form some notion of the condition of the foreign
policy of the country, by a fact that has come to the
knowledge of the writer, under circumstances that leave no
doubt, in his mind, of its authenticity. An American was
at Washington applying for some diplomatic appointment,
at the moment Congress had the subject of the French reprisals,
as recommended by the President, before them. Of
so much greater importance did this <em>diplomatic agent</em> deem
foreign than native support, that he is said to have written letters
to Paris assuring his friends there, that neither the nation
nor congress would sustain the president in his proposition!
One or more of these letters came into American hands, and
were returned to Washington. In two instances, while in
Europe, the writer found Englishmen employed in the legations
at low salaries; and, of course, the secrets of the government
were put at the disposal of foreign mercenaries.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> When General Jackson was running alone, in opposition
to Mr. Adams, the English, under the impressions alluded
to, above, and probably on account of ancient grudges, betrayed
a strong disinclination to his success. Still, Mr.
Adams was disliked, for he was believed to be unfriendly to
England, and favourable to the system of protecting duties.
Suddenly, the press of London, altered its tone in
reference to the former, and from lavishing the usual scurrility,
it began to speak of him in terms of respect. It is
said that the English agents in America, notified their government
that they were quarrelling with their bread and
butter, and that the change of policy took place in consequence.
These little occurrences should teach every American,
how to appreciate praise, or censure, that comes from
sources so venal. Mr. Adams probably understood the true
foreign policy of the government, better than any political
man who has been in power since the days of Jefferson.
The protective system, the congress of Panama, though defeated
in its objects by hostile influence, and the protest of
the administration of Mr. Monroe, which is understood to
have originated with Mr. Adams, are three of the most elevated,
far sighted, and statesman-like measures, America
ever undertook. The former, though run down by English
influence, will quite likely be called for by the very states
that now most oppose it, within the next five-and-twenty
years. Nothing is more probable, than that the Constitution
will be amended, solely with a view to this end, and
that the cotton-growing states will first move in the matter.
But for the redeeming act of the president, in recommending
reprisals against France, the writer, a near looker on for
most of the time, should say, that the character of the nation
abroad, suffered much less during the administration of
Mr. Adams, than during that of his successor, though the
diplomatic tone was not what it ought to have been, under
either administration. We boast a great deal of the dexterity
with which the nation has got out of a difficulty, while
we entirely overlook the capital fault by which it got into it.
So far from the truculent spirit of democracy, inducing the
government to rush into wars, the craven and temporising
spirit of trade, the only concentrated interest of much available
power in ordinary cases, has prevented it from maintaining
the true interests of the country, in a dozen distinct
instances, within the last twenty years.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> When the writer went to Europe, it was so unusual to
hear any thing against the system of America, that disaffection
may be said to have become extinct. On his return,
however, after an absence of less than eight years, he was
astonished to hear monarchical sentiments openly declared,
and he believes that it will be generally admitted by all candid
observers, that their avowal is now more open and more
frequent, than they have been at any time, within the present
century. This is not the place to discuss the reasons,
but this explanation is due from the writer, on his own account,
as, without it, a change that has actually taken place
among others, may be ascribed to himself. No one need be
ashamed of having honestly altered his opinions, for good
cause, and after mature examination; but since the publication
of these letters has commenced, the writer has been
openly accused of changes that, in point of fact, have occurred
among other people. Another occasion may offer to
examine this point.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> Exaggerated as this may appear, the writer has actually
been driven away, by strangers leaning over him, in this
manner, no less than eleven times, at the Astor House, within
the last twelvemonths.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> Mrs. Butler, in her shrewd work on America, has given
many good hits at this love for the grandiose. Whenever
this lady has gone out of her particular sphere, or that of
her sex, her remarks are such as might have been anticipated
from a young English woman, visiting America with all her
political prejudices about her, and almost as a matter of
course, necessarily ignorant of the true machinery and
action of governments. Even in this writer, the expectation,
not to say the <em>longing</em>, for a dissolution of the Union, that
has been so often mentioned in these pages, is sufficiently
apparent, she, also, has fallen into the very common error of
ascribing things to the institutions, such for instance as the
<em>nonchalance</em> of the trades people, and the noisy, screeching,
hoydenish romps of the sexes, which it suits the caprices
of certain people to term society, when they ought to
be referred, one to the personal independence of a country
prosperous beyond example, and the other to the unsettled
condition of towns, that double their population every twenty
years, and their wealth in ten.</p>

<p>Mrs. Butler has made many other mistakes, beyond a
question, for she has written under erroneous impressions at
starting. Of this class are all the misconceptions connected
with those usages that are thought to be tending daily towards
aristocracy. Any one who knows the country well,
knows that in all the ordinary appliances of this nature,
America has been gradually receding from such forms, for
the last forty years. Thus footmen, liveries, hatchments,
coats of arms, &amp;c. &amp;c., are all much less common now,
than at the commencement of the century. Mrs. Butler has
mistaken the twilight, for the dawn; the shadows of the
past for those of coming events. This is a common misapprehension
of the English, and it arises from a disposition
to see things in their own way.</p>

<p>The treatment that this lady has received, cannot be too
loudly condemned. She has been derided, caricatured, almost,
if not positively, slandered, because she has presumed
to speak the truth about us! Mrs. Trollope has met with
similar denunciations, though with a greater show of reason,
for Mrs. Trollope has calumniated her own sex in America.
Besides, one sees, in the book of Mrs. Trollope, a malignant
feeling, and calculations of profit; while the work of Mrs.
Butler is as honest as it is fearless. The latter has designated
persons too plainly, perhaps, as coupled with unpleasant
remarks; but all these faults may be overlooked, as the
whims of a very young female.</p>

<p>In one thing Mrs. Butler is singularly mistaken. She
says that neither England, nor France, manifests any sensibility
on the subject of the comments of travellers! The
French do not, ordinarily, understand the comments of the
English, or the English those of the French. Neither nation
reads nor knows any thing about the comments of the
Americans at all. Nothing is easier than to manifest indifference
to things of which we are totally ignorant. As respects
the English, however, one has only to name Pillet, d’ Haussez,
and Puckler-Muskau, in order to show how much abuse
and calumny they can heap on those whose opinions displease
them. The stories circulated in English society, concerning
the latter, by way of retaliation for his book, were
quite on a level with the Trollopeana of America. Both are
a disgrace to civilization.</p>
